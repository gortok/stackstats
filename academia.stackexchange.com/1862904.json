I have eleven years experience with application development, ten of it in the WINS stack. I practice and champion Test-Driven Design (TDD) and the Agile life-cycle. I am a very good verbal and written communicator; my ability to communicate ideas is one of the skills I am most often recognized for.</p>\n\n<p>I started tinkering with various flavors of BASIC and writing web pages in Notepad back in junior high, and never stopped acquiring new languages and frameworks ever since. I actually enjoy working on low-level problems, back-end systems, and obscure formats more so than front-end projects. At the same time, I want to see user-interfaces and technology in general (continue to) break away from being defined by convention and ideology and instead be more about what people need to get done.</p>\n","Location":"Utah"}
