I frequently code in my spare time and have been deeply involved in computing for as long as I can remember (my earliest memories are navigating my full 4 GB hard drive on Windows 95 and thinking, what is all this junk occupying <code>C:\\windows\\</code> and taking up room for all my games? Delete!).</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to share my tips and tricks and anything else I've picked up over the years with the StackExchange community, so I look forward to helping!</p>\n","Location":"United Kingdom"}
