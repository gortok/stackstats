All my life I've had an interest in how computers worked. In 8th grade I was given a book on programming in C++ and spent the rest of that year filling my head with its contents. I've been programming seriously now for almost 10 years and recently entered my 2nd year at Florida International University as an undergrad of Computer Science.</p>\n","Location":"Florida International University, FL"}
