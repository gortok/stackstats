My name's Geoffrey and I’m a junior in high school from North Carolina. My main interest/hobby is German (I’ve been learning since August 2011). When I go to college I want to study German and Supply Chain Management. Then I either want to go to graduate school to become a German professor or become a supply chain manager/operations manager at a German company or a company with German subsidiaries. \n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/notgeoffrey_\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeoffreyDanielBell\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a> | Maybe I'll get a blog one day :)</p>\n","Location":"North Carolina"}
