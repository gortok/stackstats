Programmer (and electronics technician) by trade, problem-solver by inclination.</p>\n\n<p>Now been unemployed for 14 years+, despite the alleged \"skills shortage\" and the \"efforts\" of websites, more than twenty \"recruitment agents\" and an entire government department. Employers prefer to engage a \"new grad\" who's \"up-to-date\" you see. They're \"easier to train\" (ie. they're cheaper and don't have the experience to tell the boss he's an idiot.)</p>\n\n<p>So - I don't mind solving even dumb and obvious problems. Keeps whats left of my grey-matter from solidifying. At least people who place questions here have the wit to do so, unlike the average \"computer expert\" waving a \"qualification\" obtained on the demographics plan...</p>\n\n<p>I've now lost interest in computing in general since the world only wants \"qualified\" cowboys who treat technical issues as some bizarre variety of popularity contest.</p>\n\n<p>I was away from SO for a while because of the power-drunk noobie mods. I've now decided to ignore them.</p>\n","Location":"Perth, Western Australia"}
