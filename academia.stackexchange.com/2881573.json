In philosophical logic, modal logics of all kinds, many-valued logics, and paraconsistent logics. Currently studying the proof theory and semantics of vague languages / many-valued logics. In math logic, I play around with model theory and occasionally recursion theory. I have nascent, but sincere interest in formal language theory, especially context free grammars and various extensions of the same.</p>\n\n<p>I also have interests in Islamic theology / philosophy, Semitic traditions and culture, and a host of other things.</p>\n","Location":""}
