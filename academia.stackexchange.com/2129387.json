I graduated from Rutgers University in 2015. Right now I'm interested in harmonic analysis and PDEs. I also like functional analysis and topology. But I've got at least a passing interest in almost everything else!</p>\n\n<p>My upcoming reading list, once I find more free time:</p>\n\n<p><em>The Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators,</em> Lars Hormander.</p>\n\n<p><em>Ordinary Differential Equations,</em> and <em>Mathematical Methods of Classical Physics,</em> V. I. Arnold.</p>\n\n<p><em>Elliptic Partial Differential Equations of Second Order,</em> Gilbarg &amp; Trudinger.</p>\n\n<p><em>Singular Integrals and Differentiability Properties of Functions,</em> Elias Stein.</p>\n\n<p><em>Introduction to Harmonic Analysis,</em> Yitzhak Katznelson.</p>\n","Location":"UCLA"}
