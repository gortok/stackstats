Forth, NEAT/3, LISP, Fortran).</p>\n\n<p>Recently I have been working on MUD (multi-user dungeon) games, doing both a Windows client called <a href=\"http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/bbshowpost.php?bbsection_id=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">MUSHclient</a> (which also runs under Wine on Mac / Linux) and support for MUD-game servers, including adding Lua scripting.</p>\n\n<p>I am an enthusiastic supporter of Lua, which is extremely useful for embedded scripting, plus small to medium-scale tasks.</p>\n\n<p>I have rekindled my interest in electronics, born in the days of being a teenager, working with the old \"valve\" amplifiers. Nowadays with transistors and micro-controllers, such as the Arduino.</p>\n\n<p>I also develop my own web pages, including my own forum software on my website. </p>\n\n<p>My <a href=\"http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?bbtopic_id=123\" rel=\"nofollow\">Electronics</a> and microprocessors posts are intended as reference material for things like interrupts, timers, low-power usage, and related material.</p>\n\n<p>I am a moderator on The <a href=\"http://forum.arduino.cc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arduino Forum</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am providing technical support for the Heidelberg Historical Society as a volunteer.</p>\n\n\n","Location":"Melbourne, Australia"}
