I was born in Ithaca, NY, and studied biomechanical engineering and engineering physics there at Cornell, before getting my M.Sc. Applied Physics from the TU Delft in the Netherlands.</p>\n\n<p>I have a melancholic personality. This means that I am pretty average in the spheres of coming up with ideas, planning out approaches, or getting stuff done: but I automatically refine things to be better/clearer. Most of the ideas in my answers are therefore carefully crafted, and where they explode in complexity it is usually because I don't know a less-complex way to fully express the point. The short-hand steps in the middle that I use may run over your head. <strong>Please feel free</strong> to ask me in comments to \"dumb down\" these sorts of details; and I will do my best. </p>\n\n<p>So, for example, the work-energy theorem <em>can</em> be worked out, in a limited sense, with <em>plain middle-school algebra</em>: but if you know vectors and calculus, the \"differential\" form (P = dK/dt) is much easier and clearer to start with, and the work-energy theorem is just the time-integral of that. So I will tend towards the \"easy/clear\" version: but if you don't know vectors and calculus, you're going to miss out! If you are reading this because that has happened, <strong>ask me in comments</strong> for the lower-skill-level explanation, and I will try to give you that middle-school algebra version.</p>\n\n<p>(But, for your own good, learn vectors and calculus. It is a tragedy that people try to teach physics without some \"0th-year-course\" on those topics. In fact college courses seem to reteach the same stuff year after year at all skill levels, just because they don't want to set aside a prerequisite freshman course on the subject to teach it to everyone together.)</p>\n","Location":"Kansas City, MO"}
