My research focus is the intersection of autonomous systems, robotics, and space exploration -- but I am interested in all aspects of science and technology. I have lots of experience with engineering subjects like solid mechanics, CAD, control systems, kinematics and dynamics, vibration, aerospace systems, spacecraft systems, finite element modeling, simulation, signal processing, sensors and instrumentation, robotics, computer vision... and more. MATLAB has been my preferred environment for developing and testing algorithms, but I also use C++ and apply it within ROS for robotics applications. Libraries like OpenCV, PCL, VTK, and others are tools I am also gaining experience using.</p>\n","Location":"Kingston, Canada"}
