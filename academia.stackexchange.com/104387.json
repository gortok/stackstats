At this time though, I generally work on jail and prison sotware, using predominantly ActionScript 3.0 and Visual Basic .NET.  Generally I work with video chat and monitoring software, often including a logistical interface for operators at the facilities.  I hope to eventually use the valuable experience from my current job as a springboard for my long-term goals as a programmer and a Christian.</p>\n","Location":"Alabama"}
