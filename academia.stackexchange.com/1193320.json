I have been using R since it was S-plus (back in the late 90s).  Despite this I have an unfortunate tendency to resort to the <code>for</code> loop, which is not exactly favoured in R practice, probably because I learned to program using Turbo Pascal version 5.5!</p>\n","Location":"Ontario, Canada"}
