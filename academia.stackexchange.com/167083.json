He spent too many years writing software <em>just</em> for fun on the side while working retail to pay the bills. </p>\n\n<p>Martin picked up professional experience working as a private contractor for Nocturnal Entertainment Australia on the Game Boy Advance title Ultimate Arcade Games. With a shiped title under his belt he attempted to move into a full time position in the industry but ultimately fell short. \nDisappointed, Martin decided to return to school to flesh out his skill set. In the process he discovered he enjoyed the problem solving and design of complex systems more than the game development. He graduated at(or nearly so) the top of his class at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a degree in Computer Engineering. </p>\n\n<p>Today he works on the Enterprise Management Technologies team at Quad/Graphics.</p>\n\n<h1>SOreadytohelp</h1>\n","Location":"West Allis, WI"}
