On 2004, I moved to using <strong>LaTeX</strong> and <strong>Unicode</strong>, and on 2007 I started using <strong>XeLaTeX</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I like the way LaTeX can broaden the possibilities of <strong>writing,</strong> I like the way it is <strong>shaped</strong>, I like the way it guides my <strong>workflow</strong>, I like the <strong>community</strong>, and of course I like the beautiful <strong>output</strong>.</p>\n","Location":"Jerusalem"}
