I've started looking at ARM and PIC parts as well.  Communications is mostly RS485 or PLC, and protocols are Modbus (RTU and TCP) or proprietary.</p>\n\n<p>I've also been doing a fair bit of circuit design and PCB layout of late, which I actually started doing long before I ever wrote a lick of software.  Apparently I'm regressing.  I'm back to thinking that 2KB RAM is \"a lot\".  I expect to be playing with Legos and milk carton building blocks in another 10 or 15 years.</p>\n","Location":"Austin, TX"}
