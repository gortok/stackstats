I used LaTeX throughout university and now in my PHD thesis. I am not a geek but an advanced user. I like to use <code>tikz</code> and <code>pgfplots</code> especially in combination with the <code>animate</code> package.</p>\n\n<p>I am very interested in <em>best practice</em> related to LaTeX.</p>\n\n<p>I made a LaTeX introduction (6 hour course for PHD students) several times. The files can be downloaded at my <a href=\"http://bedienhaptik.de/dissertation/hintergrund/\" rel=\"nofollow\">webpage</a> (it's in German but with a lot of code examples together with the results).</p>\n\n<p>In addition I had a lot to to with statistics. Especially the effect size for the <em>t-test</em> for <em>repeated measurements</em>. </p>\n\n<p>I made a presentation (in German) with animations about basic statistic concepts including alpha and beta error and effect size: <a href=\"http://bedienhaptik.de/dissertation/hintergrund/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PDF with animations</a> (scroll to the end of the site)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Text blocks</h1>\n\n<h2>Do it for me...</h2>\n\n<p>Your question leaves all the effort to our community, even typing the essentials of a TeX document such as <code>\\documentclass{}...\\begin{document}</code> etc. As it is, most of our users will be very reluctant to touch your question, and you are left to the mercy of our procrastination team who are very few in number and very picky about selecting questions. You can improve your question by adding a <a href=\"http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/228\">minimal working example (MWE)</a> that more users can copy/paste onto their systems to work on.
