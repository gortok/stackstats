I spent over a decade as a software engineer, programming primarily in C# and now Java. I'm served as a board member and organization secretary for Agile Denver, which promotes lean and agile delivery methods across the Colorado Front Range. </p>\n\n<p>I am dedicated to constant improvement. As a programmer, I experiment in other languages like Ruby, Node.js, Angular.js, Scala and F#. And I am pursuing an MBA in order to gain a deeper understanding of delivering software that's of value to businesses.</p>\n\n<p>When I'm not working, I enjoy board games, hiking, soccer, and tabletop roleplaying games.</p>\n","Location":"Colorado"}
