My primary areas of interest are scientific computing, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and software engineering. I've studied the Sun by running massively parallel simulations and analyzing the results. I currently study the MHD of Saturn's thermosphere. </p>\n\n<p>I have been programming for many years. I may not be in a position to be able to answer a lot at this time, but I can still contribute by voting up/down and/or modifying others' answers! :-)</p>\n\n<p>Areas of interest are listed below, in descending order of familiarity.</p>\n\n<h2>Computing Experience</h2>\n\n<h3>Operating System Experience:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mac OS X</li>\n<li>Linux (generic)</li>\n<li>Windows XP and later (limited)</li>\n<li>Supercomputing environments (generic, limited)</li>\n<li>TI OS (TI-84+)  :-)</li>\n<li>zOS (IBM mainframes, limited)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Programming Language Experience</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fortran (90 and later)</li>\n<li>MATLAB / Octave</li>\n<li>BASH scripting</li>\n<li>C/C++</li>\n<li>Java</li>\n<li>Python</li>\n<li>TI-BASIC</li>\n<li>HTML5, PHP (limited experience)</li>\n<li>[I am familiar with several others.] </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Other \"Languages\":</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MPI</li>\n<li>Makefile scripting</li>\n<li>GNUPlot</li>\n<li>CSS (limited)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Experience by Topic</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fourier Transforms (FFTW, (D)FFTPACK5.1, MATLAB), though less so when it comes to signal analysis applications</li>\n<li>Finite difference methods (ordinary, combined-compact, uniform or nonuniform grids)</li>\n<li>Spectral transform and psuedospectral methods for solving partial differential equations</li>\n<li>General numerical analysis</li>\n<li>Plasma physics</li>\n<li>Solar physics</li>\n<li>OpenGL (very limited)</li>\n</ul>\n","Location":""}
