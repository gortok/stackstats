I breathe code, and want to instill in everybody I meet a little bit of how wonderful the art can be. I constantly strive to improve, to learn, and to create the cleanest code I know how. I am language agnostic, and believe every language has appropriate uses, though my favorite is C++.</p>\n","Location":"Los Gatos, CA"}
