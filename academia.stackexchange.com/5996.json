I pride myself not only on my ability to understand technical systems, but also how I can communicate with others at their level, be they a junior programmer, software architect, senior management, or a business stakeholder. As for programming, I enjoy Java and have used it for web sites, web services, rich clients, and batch processing. I love new problems and learning new technologies.</p>\n","Location":"Dixon, CA"}
