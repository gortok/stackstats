If that's with a library or a code snippet. </p>\n\n<p>• Sometimes I'll post a question and someone marks the question \"didn't research. found on Google\". No, I did research but the answer was insufficient, I couldn't find what you found or the answer didn't exist on SE. Usually it's both insufficient and isn't on SE. One day, I visited ten sites in Google search results that were down and I couldn't find the information I was looking for. I noticed a pattern. Sites seem to last 5 to 10 years. Some are here one day and gone the next. So occasionally I'll post questions for posterity because most likely I'll need to reference that answer again ...and I have had to go back to past questions in the past. Yes, the answer may exist somewhere else but in my defense Stack Exchange recommends writing full responses to questions rather than linking to other sites for this exact same reason. </p>\n\n<p>If you're going to criticize my questions just move on. Don't even comment. </p>\n\n<p>Languages:\nFlex, Flash, AS3, AIR, PHP, JS, ASP, JSP, Java, .NET, etc</p>\n","Location":"California"}
