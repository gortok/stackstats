I am currently working on lots of different projects, but I have focused on high-performance server work and Swing client work in the past.  I've developed in multiple languages on multiple platforms, working seriously with PHP, ASP, Unix C/C++, MS SQL Server, and MySQL.</p>\n\n<p>I take a very direct approach to programming.  I don't bow to convention simply because it is.  Remember that DOS was a standard at one point.  Remember that Windows still is a standard.  Does it work, yes, I suppose, most of the time it does.  I would build it much differently.</p>\n","Location":"Chicago, IL"}
