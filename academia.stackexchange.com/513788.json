I've been using LaTeX since 2007 for virtually everything - articles, theses, songbooks, music sheets, slides, labels, visiting cards, you name it. TeX/LaTeX is always my first choice when I have to produce high quality documents. I never regreted of using it.</p>\n\n<p>Though I'm light years far from being a TeXpert, I'm always eager to learn.</p>\n\n<p>On the Computer Science side, my areas of interest include Automata Theory, Adaptive Technology and Programming Languages. I have some opensource projects hosted in <a href=\"http://cereda.users.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"SourceForge.net\">SourceForge.net</a> and <a href=\"http://github.com/cereda\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"GitHub.com\">GitHub.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My humble contributions to CTAN, TeX Live and the TeX community so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cereda/arara\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>arara</code></a>: a TeX automation tool based on rules and directives. <code>arara</code> gives you subsidies to enhance your TeX experience.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ctan.org/pkg/checkcites\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>checkcites</code></a>: a Lua script written for the sole purpose of detecting unused or undefined references from both LaTeX auxiliary or bibliography files. My good friend <a href=\"http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/4427\">Enrico Gregorio</a> encouraged me and gave me great ideas to write this script, so we came up with this script.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cereda/texlive-ptbr\" rel=\"nofollow\">TeX Live PT-BR</a>: This project consists of providing a Brazilian Portuguese translation file for TeX Live. The translation file <code>pt_br.po</code> is now incorporated into the official release in order to provide localized content to the TeX users in the Portuguese-speaking countries.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://texprinter.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TeXPrinter</a>: TeXPrinter is a Java application designed for the sole purpose of printing threads from here. TeXPrinter currently can print threads to <code>tex</code> and <code>pdf</code> formats.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In my ToDo list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Implement <code>dandelion</code> with my good friend <a href=\"http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/2707\">Bruno Le Floch</a>.</li>\n<li>Finish <em>The TeXbook</em> and <em>The LaTeX Companion</em>.</li>\n<li>Learn Metapost, PSTricks and TikZ, in that order.</li>\n<li>Learn LaTeX3 and somehow help the project.</li>\n<li>Implement a complete LaTeX3 editor.</li>\n<li>Go to a TUG conference.</li>\n<li>Lure <a href=\"http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/579\">Barbara Beeton</a> to sign my <em>TeXbook</em>. <code>:P</code></li>\n<li>Lure <a href=\"http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/10109\">Frank Mittelbach</a> to sign my <em>LaTeX companion</em>. <code>:P</code></li>\n<li>Watch a cricket match with <a href=\"http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/73\">Joseph Wright</a> and <a href=\"http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/1090\">David Carlisle</a>.</li>\n<li>Have a pet duck. <code>:)</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you want to support LaTeX development by a donation, the best way to do this is donating to the <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TeX Users Group</a>.</p>\n\n<p>LaTeX isn't for everyone but it could be for you. <code>:)</code></p>\n","Location":"Brazil"}
