When I was 27 a crazy turn of events inspired me finish my BA, which then became my BA/MA, in pure math at Hunter College.  I'm grateful to Prof. John Loustau at Hunter for encouraging me to go further.  I'm currently a PhD candidate at the CUNY Graduate Center.</p>\n\n<p>Algebra-related stuff comes most easily to me but I'm more interested in applications of it to other fields, especially topology and prime number theory (preferably both).  Other topics I've studied at post MA-level fall under: differential geometry, set theory, model theory, algebraic topology, algebraic number theory, and dynamical systems.  My current focus (and dissertation topic) is the role of quaternion algebras in the theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  My adviser is Abhijit Champanerkar.</p>\n","Location":"New York, United States"}
