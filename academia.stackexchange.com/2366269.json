I turn dials. I read numbers. Sometimes I make up little stories in my head about what the numbers mean.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm a grad student in statistics and psychometrics at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Interested in the development and use of mathematical models of human behavior, and the role of memory as a theoretical bridge point between perception and action. Unsavory love for Bayes factors. </p>\n\n<p>If you have any thoughts or feedback for any of my posts, please don't hesitate to comment or to engage me in our <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2250/the-axon-terminal\">Axon Terminal chat room</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The bear is Googles.
