Friends make me play League of Legends a lot, but I am more of a strategy games fan. \nIn the rare occasions of outdoor activity I run after footballs, climb walls or jump after beachvolleyballs in the sand. \nIf I do get bored of the lack of mental challenge at work, I try myself in understanding the great and wise our species has brought forth, like Einstein, Feynman or Douglas Adams.</p>\n","Location":"Germany"}
