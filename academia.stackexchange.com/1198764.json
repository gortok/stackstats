I will have to start adding reference to each of the StackExchange sites to seem a bit more multidimensional.</p>\n\n<p>superuser:  I got an Apple IIe at about 10 years of age. I became a computer gamer. Then you needed to know how to wiggle, jiggle, manipulate, and navigate all around a computer (at least software side) to get it to do what you wanted. I was motivated to learn and worked long and hard at it. Now, like many of you I am sure, I am the the go-to guy when it comes to fixing, tweaking, or simply using the potential of friends and neighbors computers.</p>\n\n<p>Role-Playing Games: GMed on and off over the years. Mostly off for the past 10 years or so. Starting things back up. Have started to formalize my last campaign in a wiki and am resurrecting it as I type! Thus I am here to seek the insight and experiences of others.</p>\n\n<p>wiki.enclaverpg.org is my campaign site\nforum.enclaverpg.org is my attempt at moving some of the play and day to day routines onto the web</p>\n","Location":"Michigan"}
