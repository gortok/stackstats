My main research interests these days is tests of gravity on cosmological scales and numerical (N-body) simulations of structure formation in gravitational theories that go beyond General Relativity. I completed my PhD in Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo in 2013.</p>\n","Location":"Oxford, United Kingdom"}
