Interested in Semantic Web, Linked Open Data, Information Visualization and Semantic Multimedia. I work mostly with JavaScript, Python and Java. My interest in programming languages (especially dynamic ones) has led me to test/benchmark different programming languages and frameworks. Before my PhD I worked as a Java programmer for a number of years in different outsourcing companies from Romania. After I started my PhD studies I discovered they required me to travel a lot and at some point I moved to Austria. Here I became interested in Information Visualization (especially with the d3.js framework), high performance JavaScript and frontend issues. Since my work is concerned with Semantic Web, my articles and most of the projects I work for are related to this area. From the semantic stack of technologies I use Sesame, RDF, OWL, SPARQL, and a bit of reasoning.</p>\n","Location":"Vienna, Austria"}
