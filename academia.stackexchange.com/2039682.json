I taught as a college lecturer in Oxford for about five years, before taking a position as a researcher in the field of English linguistic history with a major publisher. I then went over to the dark side (for the cookies, of course), and now work as a data analyst for the same company, mainly dealing with XML data (and therefore XSLT), but also branching out into Adobe CS6 and all its wonders. I'm really grateful for any and all help as I learn all this new tech, and I'm always happy to return the favour by giving linguistic help when I can.</p>\n","Location":""}
