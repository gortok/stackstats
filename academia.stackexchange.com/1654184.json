Really started studying (poorly) electronics while working in my high school's theater, trying to understand how the equipment worked. Started working for a professional production company, and a workplace accident convinced me to bail on audio and go to Purdue and study EE. Currently designing life science research instrumentation and working on my MSEE through Ohio University.</p>\n","Location":""}
