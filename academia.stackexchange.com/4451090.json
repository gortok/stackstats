I <a href=\"http://lichess.org/@/Unihedron\" rel=\"nofollow\">play, moderate</a> and write code for <a href=\"http://lichess.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lichess</a>. I like helping.

Don't be afraid if I appear like a stalker. Don't worry, I'll take really good care of you &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>By day: I'm probably curled up on my coach, from where I woke up and have been spending my entire day so far <a href=\"https://github.com/Unihedro\" rel=\"nofollow\">coding</a>, surfing the net and doing various things, and (still) wearing <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00PDMRGRU\" rel=\"nofollow\">a pair of wireless headphones</a> (not noticing the podcast I was listening to has already ended (a long time ago)) with the same outfit as always. Occasionally away, always watching, or fallen asleep.</p>\n\n<p>By night: Likely still the same?</p>\n\n<p>See you soon, dear. ^_^</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the past I offered all content I author on the Stack Exchange network also under The MirOS Licence. <strong>This is no longer the case as <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/271080/266094\">Stack Exchange is now adopting a CC-0-like license</a>, which I dislike and will be boycotting it by no longer <em>writing code</em> here.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EbqXa.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","Location":"Earth, Alpha Centauri"}
