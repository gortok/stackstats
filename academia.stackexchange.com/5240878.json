I got my PhD in math in 2014. My dissertation (<a href=\"https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/44221/\" rel=\"nofollow\">read it here</a>) is about the curious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_algebroid\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hopf algebroid</a> structure on the torus-equivariant cohomology ring of a generalized flag variety (though the main result was leveraging the properties of this algebroid to give a Leibniz formula for divided difference operators arising from Coxeter groups). In a sense the equivariant cohomology ring is more fundamental than the cohomology ring because the structure constants arise in an elementary way from a Coxeter group's action on a polynomial ring.</p>\n\n<p>I am also a coauthor of <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.5419v1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">K-theory of minuscule varieties</a> where a K-theoretic analog of Knuth equivalence (aptly named K-Knuth equivalence) is introduced. I had to prove that the \"combinatorialist\" belongs there, because my dissertation is just algebra!</p>\n\n<p>As I am no longer in academia there is not a strong reason for me to write more papers (also an 8 to 5 job takes up a lot of time) but if you want to collaborate with me you can contact me by posting a comment on one of my posts.</p>\n","Location":"New Jersey"}
