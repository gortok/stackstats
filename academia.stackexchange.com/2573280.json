Now an amateur tinkerer. But <a href=\"http://www.jdawiseman.com/papers/easymath/coin-stopping.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">my estimate of the Chow & Robbins constant</a> has more decimal places than any other (as of early 2013). But could be improved: see <a href=\"http://mathoverflow.net/questions/126010/the-chow-robbins-game-0-79295350640-improvements-could-come-from-simple-stat\" rel=\"nofollow\">question</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geeks who arrange wine tastings might like <a href=\"http://www.jdawiseman.com/papers/placemat/placemat.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">my software that makes placemats</a> that are both elegant and functional.
