They are deprecated.</a> Instead, look into using <code>PDO</code> along with binding values. <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1179874/what-is-the-difference-between-bindparam-and-bindvalue\">Be aware that <code>bindValue</code> and <code>bindParam</code> work differently.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/31943849/788192\">Stop using time stamps. Use the <code>DateTime</code> object instead.</a> Convert all of your time stamps in tables to the <code>DATETIME</code> type as well. You'll no longer have to worry about which PHP architecture you're on and you'll have a plethora of functionality readily available instead of writing your own.</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/17497184/788192\">You can pass external variables into a closure's scope</a>, along with the ability to modify it (if passed by reference using <code>&amp;</code>), by using the <code>use</code> keyword. Example: </p>\n\n<p><code>$externalVar = 10; \n print_r(array_map(function($value) use (&amp;$externalVar) { \n   $externalVar++; \n   return $value * $externalVar; \n }, range(1, 10)));</code></p></li>\n<li><p>Use CSRF tokens in your forms! And clear them after single use! <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/17244070/788192\">Old laravel example</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n","Location":"Boston, MA"}
