I really hate to test my metaprograms with <code>static_assert()</code>s only! <em>(Insert future github project link here)</em><br>\nI like a lot to play with the language, exploting its capabilities until (Sadly...) the compiler colapses with an internal error.</p>\n\n<p>But not everything are crazy ideas. I have more realistic projects. For example, as a result of my personal frustration with C++ tuples, I'm currently writting a library to enance the capabilities of C++11 tuples, making the day to day work easy: <a href=\"https://github.com/Manu343726/TTL\" rel=\"nofollow\">The TTL Project</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>But that was not always the case...</h3>\n\n<p>My career as programmer started with Visual Basic 6.0, and a bit later with Visual Basic .NET. A couple of years later I decided to \"port my mind\" to the world of C#, C++, and C. \nThat decision have leaded to a wonderfull world of OO programming with C#, close to metal C, and C++ generic programming.</p>\n\n<p>I'm mostly interested in videogame programming, specifically game-engine implementations,\nso I have worked with DirectX, such as in <a href=\"https://github.com/Manu343726/cpp_lib32\" rel=\"nofollow\">my port</a> of the <a href=\"https://github.com/VisualStudioEX3/dx_lib32\" rel=\"nofollow\">dx_lib32 project</a>.<br>\nBefore that I have written a <strong>GDI+ based 3d rendering engine from scratch</strong>, using VB.NET and C#.  </p>\n\n<p>Also I have written \"experimental\" projects using C# and the Kinect for Windows SDK, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/Manu343726/KinectNormalMap\" rel=\"nofollow\">a 3d scanner <strong>to compute normal maps and render the scene</strong> at \"real time\"</a>, or a simple <a href=\"https://github.com/Manu343726/KinectStick\" rel=\"nofollow\">videogame-oriented virtual keyboard which provides <strong>speech and gesture based commands</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<h3>What about Java?</h3>\n\n<p>I really hate the Java programming language (Please note that I said <em>the programming language</em>, not the runtime nor the libraries). It suffers from years of unresolved design errors from its base, a horrible and verbose syntax, and years of not evolving at all (I know about Java 8, but think: That was which C# has 8 years before...). </p>\n\n<p>As you can see I strongly prefer C# as a OO VM-based language (\"Managed\", as Microsoft likes to say), but Java is a very common language in the programming world.<br>\nSo, even if I hate Java, I have an intermediate-low level with it. Thats what I think, but <a href=\"https://github.com/Manu343726/WALLE\" rel=\"nofollow\">judge by yourselves instead</a>.
