I've been known to respond to <code>jericson@stackexchange.com</code>. Alternatively, I maintain an <a href=\"http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/738/jons-java-jitter-joint\">office on chat</a>. (Please ignore the meta cruft.)</p>\n\n<p>I write about my experience as a community manager at <a href=\"http://jericson.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jericson.github.io</a>. You can read about what I've done over the years in my <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jericson\" title=\"Not guaranteed to be current.\"><em>curriculum vitae</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>On a personal note, I'm married and have three children.  Our oldest son loves school, friends, games, and reading.  (He can't wait to get on our <a href=\"http://bricks.stackexchange.com/\">LEGOÂ® Answers</a> site, but he's not quite old enough.  My posts there are usually at his request.)  Two of my children happen to have been born on the same day.  I <a href=\"http://taking1and1.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Yet another half-assed blog.\">sometimes write</a> about that experience.  </p>\n\n<p>Don't have time for a full review of something?
