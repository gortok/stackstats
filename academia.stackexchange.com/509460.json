I earned my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania, working in combinatorics and probability.  In particular I'm interested in what large random structures look like.  I think generating functions are awesome, which is probably pretty clearly reflected in the questions I answer.   ","Location":"Oakland, CA, USA"}
