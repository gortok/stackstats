I have published principally on comparative religion, theory of religion, and magic (or \"esotericism\" if you prefer). My principal historical focus is early modern and eighteenth-century Europe. More recently, I've become interested in music history and music theory with respect to European conceptions of religion.</p>\n","Location":""}
