Luckily I'm a chinese hamster that has been fitted with an experimental math co-processor, wet wired into my brain by Lalit Ranjan. I also have an empathy chip.</p>\n\n<p>I'm the founder and CEO of ComputerInfo.in. I am founder of BikesOnRent.in which I donâ€™t run now. And long before BikesOnRent.in , in days of yore, I co-founded a company called Paras Enterprises which you probably have heard of.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a stimulation junkie. I've had the privilege of realizing a few dreams, making me a \"requited dreamer.\" consequently, I suffer from the delusion that every product of my imagination is not only possible, but always on the cusp of becoming real.</p>\n\n<p>I'm one of the most well-adjusted tortured souls you'll ever meet.</p>\n\n<p>\"All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: But the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible.\" -T.E.
