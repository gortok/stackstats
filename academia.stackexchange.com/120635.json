I transitioned to programming from other work because I was too busy automating my own work environment to actually do the other work. I have a hobby interest in <a href=\"http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Alerque\" rel=\"nofollow\">cartography</a>. For more <strong>see my <a href=\"http://alerque.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">personal site</a></strong>. Most importantly, my life is defined by the grace of God given to men through Jesus Christ. It is my ambition that everything I do would reflect His glory and point people towards Him.</p>\n","Location":"Izmir, Turkey"}
