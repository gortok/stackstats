C++ is my trade for the last 30 years, eager to learn about new paradigms and ideas, or just better ways to do things. OpenGL, DX12 and game technology on any platform are my focus in professional life, and I have been a professional game engine dev head for nearly 10 years, and helped release quite a bunch of gaming goodness on various platforms including Xbox360, PS2, PC and some others. I'd like to think of myself as a friendly guy, so always in for a chat. Cheers.</p>\n\n<h1>SOreadytohelp</h1>\n","Location":""}
