For those wondering about the name change, none of the sites I searched had a language named par, but nevertheless I found a PPCG post in a language called Par, and it was not mine. So I changed the name.\nI sort of know Latin and Python and am fluent in English and JavaScript.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Skill is a crutch for the weak.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","Location":"California"}
