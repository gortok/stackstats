I started off as a graduate student in physics at UIUC where I worked on these projects, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01226\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01226</a>, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7714\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7714</a></p>\n\n<p>Since summer 2014, I started pursuing complexity theory and I am interested in theory of Ramanujan expanders, spectral graph theory, polytope extension complexity, Lasserre hierarchy and matrix norm sketching. I am particularly interested in questions in complexity theory which have an interface with physics.</p>\n","Location":""}
