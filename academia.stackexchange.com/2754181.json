So I can answer a lot of question about programming and of course also data-structures and any kind of common used algorithms.\nCurrently I started working with functional languages like Haskell to expand my knowledge in programming and also find new ways to solve problems more efficiently. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn some new programming languages so I can find new ways of solving problems in a more concise and efficient way.</p>\n","Location":"Munich, Germany"}
