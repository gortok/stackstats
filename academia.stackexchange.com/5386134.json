Before entering this program, I was working on a project examining the mechanisms of local sleep in wakefulness and behavioral performance in the Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin-Madison. My current focuses are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>to explore the brain's executive control system with EEG</li>\n<li>to advance the P300 based brain computer interface (BCI), a system enables severely disabled individuals with intact cognitive system (e.g., ALS patients) to communicate using computer devices;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I hope to gain a better understanding of how the mind is implemented by the brain, and gather new insights into consciousness and cognitive function.</p>\n","Location":""}
