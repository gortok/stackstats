My weapons of choice are category theory, functional analysis, and order theory; specifically, monoidal categories, operator algebras, and orthomodular lattices. I suppose you could say that my ultimate goal is to really understand the category of Hilbert spaces, in particular categorical aspects of a choice of basis.</p>\n","Location":"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"}
