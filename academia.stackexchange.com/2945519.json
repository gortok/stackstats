Strong background in proof complexity & probabilistic combinatorics. Not extremely broad algebra background, more focus on things like Group Theory / Group Representation Theory, Category Theory, than for instance Field Theory / Galois Theory. Wish I knew more analysis, harmonic analysis, wish I understood Homological Algebra better.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI like Sushi, camping, motorcycles, Nietzsche, travel, Surfing. I also like Slacklining.\r\n\r\n","Location":"Princeton, NJ"}
