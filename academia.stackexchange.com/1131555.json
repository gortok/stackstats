I hold a Bachelor's degree on Applied Mathematics and Master's in Neuroscience. So, it is not surprising that I enjoy reading about Philosophy, Cognitive Sciences, Semiotics, Computers (Hardware and Software), Ethology, Genetics, Astronomy and so on.</p>\n\n<p>I really like reading (science fiction stories by Asimov and Clarke, in particular). Another passion is dancing. My favorite rythms are tango and gafieira.</p>\n\n<p>I am a talkative guy, and I talk about everything. Of course, several times I am wrong but what really matter is the attempt to keep myself thinking about the time, the place, the people that surround us.</p>\n\n<p>So, I am a very strange guy. Are you sure you want to reach me?</p>\n\n<p>Think about it:</p>\n\n<p>\"If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them.\" - Isaac Asimov</p>\n","Location":"Sao Paulo, Brazil"}
