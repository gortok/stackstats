At times I just can't stop. At those moments I have an urge to work on a certain project. This feeling fades away though. Then I can resist it again for a couple of months. Do not tell my friends though. To them I am 'the rower guy'. They don't question my 'half-yearly' disappearances.</p>\n\n<p>PS: I hate libraries. Programming that is, I love the real ones, big ones, with interesting things everywhere.</p>\n\n<h1>SOreadytohelp</h1>\n","Location":"Netherlands"}
