I also like large scale computing and have built a small personal cluster to do distributed calculations. For example parameter optimizations, scientific simulations and batch processing when rendering hi-res fractals. My largest contribution is probably a computational framework which was the foundation for my research thesis which I presented last summer. </p>\n\n<p>Nowadays I am a free lancer looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge to research and develop cool stuff for the future.</p>\n","Location":""}
