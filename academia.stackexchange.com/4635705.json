I am always coding, or hacking on something new. I love JavaScript, Ruby, and R, and lately I have been learning Java, Python, and a little C#. I have some C under my belt, but I rarely use it. I am into collaborating with fellow programmers, as well as learning and helping a little more than usual.</p>\n","Location":""}
