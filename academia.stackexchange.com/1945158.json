His interests lie in designing applications across any combination of public and private clouds with the ability to optimally consume cloud resources based on cost, capacity and capability. His work focuses on finding techniques for automatically scaling of cloud resources in a deadline driven environment. Other than utilizing the existing threshold based techniques, Anshuman tries to find new trigger points in the system that act as better indicators. He also uses machine learning techniques to predict future traffic patterns. Anshuman relishes deploying and managing infrastructure on OpenStack with Vagrant along with provisioning tools like Puppet and Chef. He works with the mantra, “Everything that can be automated, must be automated!”</p>\n","Location":"Ottawa, Canada"}
