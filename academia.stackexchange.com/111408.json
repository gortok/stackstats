After learning to read, I managed to learn the basics of programming with the help of <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/nh/secret/#guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Secret Guide to Computers</a>, GWBASIC, <a href=\"http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/logo.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">UCBLogo</a>, LADYBUG Logo, and some LOGO book(s) I can't recall the names of. I didn't much like GWBASIC, but at least it had a printed reference manual. I had also tried QBASIC, but had trouble with the online help, which I later decided was probably because all of the text was in the same font (making it hard to tell the verbatim code from the other notation).</p>\n\n<p>[...
