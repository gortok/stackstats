Wrote my first commercial app (something I got paid for) in 1982, and I wrote a locally-successful game for the C-64 in 1985. I work in telecom, and have a company of my own. My hobbies currently are programming, RC model aircraft (planes and helicopters), rifle and pistol marksmanship, and photography.</p>\n","Location":"Lakewood, CO"}
