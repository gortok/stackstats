That being said, I also have a strong passion for Anatomy and will be using this passion to pursue a career in Medicine to hopefully, become a Surgeon (after I finish my bachelors in Medical Science). I thank the community for allowing me to be a part of the Grand Stack Exchange where I may use my passion to help others and dig deeper into my love and knowledge of Mathematics.</p>\n","Location":""}
