My main expertise is not strictly with programming, but physics and thermodynamics applied to computational Fluid Dynamics and engineering (numerical methods). My PhD is related to using moment methods to model particles as a continuum. This involves working with FORTRAN, C++ and MPI for high performance computing.</p>\n","Location":""}
