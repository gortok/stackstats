This makes people think I am intelligent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Impatience</strong>: I'm too impatient to wait for my code to run so rewrite the code to improve performance. This makes people think I am a good programmer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hubris</strong>: When someone asks if I can do something I just say Yes, then go find out how to do it (Google!). This makes people think I can do anything.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, it means I can make a career out of being Lazy, Impatient, and Hubristic(?).</p>\n","Location":"New York, United States"}
