This began through years of working with Irving Kaplansky. Much of his unpublished writing on quadratic forms can be found as pdfs at \r\nhttp://zakuski.math.utsa.edu/~kap/forms.html \r\nand about Lie and Jordan superalgebras at\r\nhttp://zakuski.math.utsa.edu/~kap/superalgebra.html\r\n\r\nOne of my own email addresses can be found easily using the search feature at \r\n\r\nhttp://www.ams.org/cml \r\n\r\nand just putting in my last name","Location":"Berkeley, California"}
