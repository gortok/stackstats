His most recent book is Proof Patterns.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/3319162497\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Proof-Patterns-Mark-Joshi/dp/3319162497/</a></p>\n\n<p>is innovative textbook introduces a new pattern-based approach to learning proof\nmethods in the mathematical sciences. Readers will discover techniques that will enable\nthem to learn new proofs across different areas of pure mathematics with ease. The\npatterns in proofs from diverse fields such as algebra, analysis, topology and number\ntheory are explored. Specific topics examined include game theory, combinatorics, and\nEuclidean geometry, enabling a broad familiarity.</p>\n\n<p>The author, an experienced lecturer and researcher renowned for his innovative\nview and intuitive style, illuminates a wide range of techniques and examples from\nduplicating the cube to triangulating polygons to the infinitude of primes to the\nfundamental theorem of algebra. Intended as a companion for undergraduate students,\nthis text is an essential addition to every aspiring mathematicianâ€™s toolkit.</p>\n","Location":""}
