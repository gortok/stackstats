I use my skills to make other people's life easier on daily basis. I blog at <a href=\"http://enklawa-tworcza.blogspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://enklawa-tworcza.blogspot.com</a> about my real-life creations that can show readers open-minded way of living. I use small and simple examples to show that everyone can solve their problems by just wanting to and doing something with that, like creating a leather pouch for a set of dice or headphones from old boots.</p>\n\n<p>As a developer, I always try to learn something new if possible. New technologies, languages, frameworks - whatever I need to do what I want to do.</p>\n\n<p>\"The bag's not for what I take - it's for what I find along the way.\" - MacGyver</p>\n","Location":"Krakow, Poland"}
