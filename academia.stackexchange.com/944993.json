It's a two part series that I designed for the CMLTD curriculum. The course starts from zero (students with no background) and ramps up to full-stack application development over two semesters. That said, what makes this course unique is the heavy emphasis of instructional design principles and learning theory, to inform the design and development of web-based learning applications. (What a mouthful.)</p>\n\n<p>I've also consulted for the United Nations, General Assembly, and I'm currently finishing up my doctorate in Instructional Media and Technology.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I have a rather unique combination and depth of specialties across:</p>\n\n<p>Design x Development x Research x Teaching</p>\n","Location":""}
