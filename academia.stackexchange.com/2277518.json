Batteries included, plethora of third party modules, syntactic sugar, large community and the Zen of Python make for a superb language.</p>\n\n<p>I am a strong believer in code quality and review, testing and continuous integration coupled with an agile methodology to deliver a high quality product. </p>\n\n<p>I thrive in teams where I can learn and get challenged every day as well as teams where I can add my own grain of sand to the mix of ideas.</p>\n\n<h1>SOreadytohelp</h1>\n","Location":"New York, United States"}
