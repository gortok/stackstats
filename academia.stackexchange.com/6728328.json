As a developer I have a tendency to seek better ways of doing things that are non-routine and these forums support me in a big way.</p>\n\n<p>Currently self-employed and actively seeking employment or projects and I'd love to hop into something long term with the right motivation.</p>\n","Location":"Berlin, Germany"}
