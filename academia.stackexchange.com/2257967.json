I am also an Associate Analyst with the <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Congressional Budget Office</a>.  (<em>Fun Fact:  The income tax microsimulation model my unit is tasked with developing/maintaining is written in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fortran</a></em>). In both capacities, I study fiscal policy.  In the former, I retrospectively evaluate subnational fiscal policy, while in the latter I prospectively model fiscal policy proposals (among other things).  The tax umbrella provides useful overlap between my professional and academic endeavors.  (I am currently ABD, writing about <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/state-local/fiscal/limits.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">tax and expenditure limitations</a>.)  Always happy to nerd out about any of these things...</p>\n","Location":"Washington, D.C."}
