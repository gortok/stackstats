I speak a pretty common middle American English with some influences from the South, and I am also fluent in Continental and Québécois French.  </p>\n\n<p>Foreign languages and linguistics are my passion (B.A. McGill 2008), and I have a heavy background in Latin (caveat emptor) as well as working competencies in Italian, Spanish, and German.</p>\n\n<p>While teaching is my vocation, I am working on my M.Ed and have a delightful background in a variety of customer service posts.  These Emmy-winning jobs give me a great sampling of language usages, and I am eager to share and learn.</p>\n\n<p>I also enjoy long walks on the beach and foreign films.</p>\n","Location":"Briar Patch, VA"}
