This means that while I greatly and most sincerely admire the life and works of the Rambam (Rabbi Mosheh ben Maimon, \"Maimonides\") in both <em>hashqafah</em> and <em>halakhah</em>, I do not feel bound to hold him as either philosophically or halakhically infallible. Instead, I use his approach and do my best to be true to the unique and stable path which he gave to Torah Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>I am also <em>Meqori</em> (a Hebrew term meaning essentially \"originalist\"/\"source-based\"). This means that I seek to be authentic in my Judaism and put emphasis on the texts of Hazal, the Geonim, and the early Rishonim, before all else which came after them.</p>\n\n<p>The mission statement of my life and journey is:</p>\n\n<p>\"To discover and practice the simple, consistent, and portable rabbinic Judaism of our fathers.\"</p>\n","Location":""}
