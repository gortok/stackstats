For the purposes of this site though I am mostly a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker\" rel=\"nofollow\">hacker</a> its original form - but only for good!</p>\n\n<p>Please take a look at <a href=\"http://superuser.com/tour\">The Tour</a> if you are new.  I appreciate your thanks if you gave it, I will not publicly acknowledge it - to limit comments.</p>\n\n<p>I try to be as accurate and as succinct as reasonable- please let me know if I am not.  Many people operate at differing levels so please do let me know if I am explaining to much or too little.  However, this is a questions and answers site and so answers should be standalone and answer the question fully.  </p>\n\n<p>I also review and edit some posts so please do not be offended if your answer is marked as not being complete etc - stackexchange does not support <a href=\"http://superuser.com/help/dont-ask\">\"me too\"</a> posts, or raising similar questions within answers.</p>\n\n<p>I am a true believer in diversity and inclusion - so yes there is no best OS, Hardware or Software for <em>everyone</em> :-)</p>\n","Location":"U.K."}
