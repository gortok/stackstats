I also mostly check mathematical Analysis, Harmonic Analysis and some other minor field such as Quantum Information Theory.\nI am so eager to see any idea in mathematical analysis. \nMy formal email is <strong>baghalghaffari@gmail.com</strong> . \nI love having contacts with any mathematical persons.</p>\n","Location":"Tabriz, Iran"}
