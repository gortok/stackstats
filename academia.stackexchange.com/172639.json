These problems typically involve a lot of parameters that are poorly known, so I mostly use Python with Numpy and Scipy to quickly whip up expressive numerical models, Sympy to develop analytical results, and Matplotlib to display my findings. I previously did high-performance computing with Fortran.</p>\n","Location":""}
