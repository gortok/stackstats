After a long hiatus, I started playing D&amp;D again after the release of the <em>Baldur's Gate</em> PC game renewed my interest in the pen and paper version. Likewise, I only started playing 3rd edition after I was solidly addicted to <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I've played (and GMed) a lot of Palladium games, particularly Robotech and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. My roleplaying group were also fans of R. Talsorian Games' <em>Cyberpunk</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2020</em>. I've also played <em>Rolemaster</em> and <em>HARP</em>, as well as <em>Earthdawn</em>.</p>\n","Location":"Brisbane, Australia"}
