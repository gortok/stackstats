I am the webmaster for several companies in the area.  I am currently using Codeigniter and my platform/framework of choice, but I have also used Drupal in the past.  I am constantly impressed by the variety of object oriented PHP that is used out there and would like to learn and contribute more to the community.  I am still learning more than I am teaching, but I have been able to accomplish a lot with the aid and expertise of the Stack Overflow community.  I am currently getting back into Drupal with a furry, so expect a lot of Drupal questions.</p>\n","Location":"Chattanooga Tn"}
