I'm a college student currently pursuing degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Engineering; as evidenced by my presence on this site, however, I also really like the nuances of the English language. </p>\n\n<p>I'm genderfluid, so as much as I think a singular gender-neutral pronoun that isn't \"they\" would be good for the English language, \"they\" is becoming the commonly-accepted one, so go ahead and use it when referring to me.</p>\n","Location":"The University of Oklahoma"}
