No books (about LaTeX) nor packages in CTAN or somewhere, but a I'm proud of a very few answers that contain not only ideas adapted from others (hint: not always they are the most upvoted).</p>\n\n<p>My apologies if you find unclear what I write, English is not my native language.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Precooked comments:</strong> <a href=\"http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/questions/430/text-building-blocks\">http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/questions/430/text-building-blocks</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/1436\">Welcome to TeX.sx!</a> Please add a <a href=\"http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/228\">minimal working example (MWE)</a> that illustrates your problem. It will be much easier for us to reproduce your situation and find out what the issue is when we see compilable code, starting with <code>\\documentclass{...}</code> and ending with <code>\\end{document}</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A tip: If you <a href=\"http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/1192\">indent lines by 4 spaces</a> or <a href=\"http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/863\">enclose words in backticks ```</a>, they'll be marked as code, as can be seen in my edit. You can also highlight the code and click the \"code\" button (with \"{}\" on it).</p>\n","Location":"Spain"}
