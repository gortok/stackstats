My interests have been in dynamical systems (especially discrete), cellular automata, and genetic algorithms - at least until I discovered MOOCs. I've completed over 30 MOOCs, in machine learning, data science, and other computer science courses. I've almost completed Coursera's Data Science Specialization, and am half-way through Georgia Tech's OMSCS program with a focus in machine learning. My current favorite languages are Python and R. </p>\n\n<p>Some of my other interests include zazen, jazz drumming, abstract art (and mathematics as art), cognitive science, the game of go, simulism, the nature of consciousness, life, the universe, and everything.</p>\n","Location":"Bakersfield, California"}
