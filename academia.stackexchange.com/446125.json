My aim and the goal of my PhD's project is to develop a portable real-time EEG-based neurofeedback system for improving human attention.</p>\n\n<p>I'm interested in the computational and information-theoretic properties, limits and behaviors of different types of theoretical and real systems: automata theory, approximation theory, artificial and biological networks (e.g. social networks, gene-gene networks, protein-protein, neural networks). I like theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, mathematics, statistics and data analysis and I try to be a Bayesian inductive reasoner as much as practically possible in everyday life.</p>\n","Location":"London, United Kingdom"}
