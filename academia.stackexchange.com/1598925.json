This page doesn't send emails to me, why? Because I want to decide WHEN I visit this site and which questions I answer. Comment the questions and answers, open new questions. When I'm here the next time I may comment your comment - or not. If you want my expertise or time you can hire me.</p>\n","Location":"Berlin, Germany"}
