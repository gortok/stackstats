The superpowers now have\n  more than 50,000 nuclear warheads, enough to destroy our planet many\n  times. Yet the sunrise is beautiful, and the rose that bloomed this\n  morning along the wall is a miracle. Life is both dreadful and\n  wonderful. To practice meditation is to be in touch with both aspects.\n  Please do not think we must be solemn in order to meditate. In fact,\n  to meditate well, we have to smile a lot. </p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>A human being is like a television set with millions of channels. If\n  we turn the Buddha on, we are the Buddha. If we turn a smile on, we\n  really are the smile. We cannot let just one channel dominate us. We\n  have the seed of everything in us, and we have to seize the situation\n  in our hand, to recover our own sovereignty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Extracted from <a href=\"http://www.redrat.net/thoughts/wtc/suffering.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Suffering is not enough\", by Thich Nhat Hanh</a></p>\n","Location":"..."}
