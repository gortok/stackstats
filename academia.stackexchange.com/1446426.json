If it means money to pay the bills, even better!</p>\n\n<p>I have worked with a lot of technologies, from home-computer BASIC and assembly to C to Ruby and JavaScript. I would cautiously say that the language that most excites me currently is Clojure, but I'm open to lots of things.</p>\n\n<p>I like learning about how things from one perspective or paradigm are implemented in another, e.g. object-oriented behavior out of a procedural language like C. The functional worldview seems like one I would be well-served to really take the time to learn and practice.</p>\n\n<p>My day-to-day personal computing setup is in Mac OS X, but I also use a Linux desktop as a backup server and for general tinkering; and I use Windows 7 at work. I feel pretty comfortable in all three.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't been terribly active on StackExchange lately, but I'm hoping to remedy that, as long as I don't let it overshadow actual coding.</p>\n","Location":"Wisconsin"}
