The technical answers require more effort to put together, but they seem to get few or no upvotes.  I think people don't upvote answers to technical questions as much because effort is required to verify their correctness, as opposed to simply agreeing with someone's subjective opinion.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe more difficult the technical question was to answer, the less people there will be with the technical capability to evaluate your answer for correctness.  Therefore the difficulty of answering the question is likely to have an inverse effect on the total upvotes received.","Location":""}
