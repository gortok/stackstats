Le</strong> and there is nothing wrong with that,<br>\n i changed my name in this account just to put an end to the people mocking my name.<br>\n <code>Ehem*Mod*Ehem*Wombat?*Ehem*Ninja*</code></p>\n\n<p>Actually this is my <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/202420/236100\">favorite post</a> you can see in the comments the discussion on how i explained my self against those people that only accepts the words/names that are acceptable in their nature, that post can also show how rude people can be. Well it is really a shame to see people go to that extent just to prove their nonsense rudeness, if you want to be respected, learn to respect others too, specially their <strong>NAME!</strong> as it was given to them by their parents.  </p>\n\n<p>So please to other people that would downvote my posts because of my exotic name, back off. the world is not yours and the words that you accept based on your culture are not the <strong>ONLY</strong> words that are valid in this world.</p>\n","Location":"Area 51"}
