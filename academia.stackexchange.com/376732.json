I don't know why I like answering SO questions but for some reason it's not work when you get points for it. Sisyphus just needed a <a href=\"http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3259\" rel=\"nofollow\">score board</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm interested in A.I., futurism, philosophy and politics (the theory, not the circus).
