Also some frameworks are familiar to me, such as Mule ESB, Camel ESB, Spring, Django, CodeIgniter and more. I've done my share of DBA work, delving into Oracle 10g+, PostgreSQL 7+, MySQL 5+, for starters. </p>\n\n<p>In my spare time, I enjoy LEGO collecting, woodworking, hobby electronics, reading, writing, and arithmetic. No, seriously, I like math.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, with some luck perhaps I can contribute in a meaningful way to this community.</p>\n","Location":"New Jersey, USA"}
