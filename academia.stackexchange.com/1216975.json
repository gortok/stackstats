In addition to the two fields mentioned above, I'm very interested in the fields of Physics, Computer Programming (Python), Web Design, Philosophy, and English. I really like music (especially elctronic, club house, pop, etc.), art (Dali, Picaso, Kandinsky, Sandro Botticelli, etc.), gaming, and good humor to mention a few. I'd like to go in more detail, but can't since I'm mostly on a tight schedule.</p>\n","Location":"New York, United States"}
