I kind of fell in love with Perl when i had to use it at work. However i have come to oppose the notion of code being more perly the less readable it is. I believe one of Perls beauties is the possibility to write it in a way that every programmer can easily read and understand it, even if they never have touched Perl before.</p>\n\n<p>As such the stuff i write is probably not elegant or (at least when it comes to Perl) overly efficient but hopefully it gets the job done. ^^</p>\n","Location":"Hamburg, Germany"}
