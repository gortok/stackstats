Just note that I don't really believe in social constructs when they get in the way of satisficing (or in the way of my goal of learning as much as possible). </p>\n\n<p>Don't take anything I say/do too seriously.  A lot of the things I do (that may look weird/stupid on the outside) are the types of things that help me adjust my posterior probability of various things - especially low probability events.Sometimes I hit on a jackpot/very interesting idea. I'm kind of messy since it helps facilitate creative destruction.</p>\n\n<p>I have <em>a lot</em> of respect for <em>all</em> of the sciences. Tactically, I'm developing heuristics for rationality, impartiality, anti-laziness, and creation+identification+searching for what's relevant+reliable. Strategically, I just want to learn everything.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of my thought processes involve my creating new hypotheses and refuting them on my own. I still document the thought process since it's important and may be important for future \"true\" hypotheses.</p>\n","Location":"Seattle, WA"}
