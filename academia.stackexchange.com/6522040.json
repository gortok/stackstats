Research interests are in the realm of in vitro pharmacology, physiology, and neuroscience. Hard-working and tenacious about research and love to collaborate and learn from others. I enjoy working with others in various disciplines in order to achieve a common goal. I learn more about techniques and approaches than I otherwise would encounter in my current field. Also, in the process, I enjoy making new friends.  </p>\n","Location":"United States"}
