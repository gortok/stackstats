No court</strong>\n  <strong>or legislature on this planet can change that fact.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>SOreadytohelp</h1>\n\n<p>TecBrat, the frankencoder:</p>\n\n<p>I never expected to be a business owner, but circumstances led me to host and maintain a few websites, so I formed TecBrat.com LLC as a <a href=\"http://www.tecbrat.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">PHP Web Developer</a> and am getting a good start. I'm sure I'll be on SO as much as or more than I was before.</p>\n\n<p>Very little organized training (High School AP class in 1991) but several years of experience hacking together pieces of code. </p>\n\n<p>I greatly appreciate the willingness of the community to help each other improve their coding skills.</p>\n\n<p>Learning JQuery. I am hoping it is a shortcut to learning more JS. So far, I find it helpful and have begun to find extensions / plugins that make it even better.</p>\n\n<p>I joined specifically for PHP programming Q&amp;A, but I found myself much more active on EL&amp;U for a while. I have only my own experience and my highschool education to guide my answers on EL&amp;U.</p>\n\n<p>(I changed the \"f\" in \"frankencoder\" to lower case because the proper name apparently belongs to a guy name Phillip, and I wouldn't want someone else calling themselves \"TecBrat\")</p>\n","Location":"Florida"}
