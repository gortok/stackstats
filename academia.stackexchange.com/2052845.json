It's great learning something new on Stack Overflow and other Stack Exchange sites every day.</p>\n\n<p>Currently I'm proficient in the following languages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>JavaScript (by far my most common for my answers on Stack Overflow)</li>\n<li>HTML</li>\n<li>CSS</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've started off learning Python - it's slightly different to JavaScript but so far it's been surprisingly easy to use.</p>\n\n<p>I find PHP rather horrid -- it's just too big of a mess to deal with and I abhor the giant blob of functions.  I wouldn't even recommend it for a newbie - not only is it rather dissimilar to other languages, you have to spend half your time reading the PHP manual to figure out what a method does, which cuts down on productivity and learning significantly.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, some of the languages I'm learning now or considering to in the future are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lua</li>\n<li>C#</li>\n<li>Racket</li>\n<li>(and if this doesn't take a decade) Haskell</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've moved to HK just recently, originally from Sydney, Australia.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Top 13 on Stack Overflow <a href=\"http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/131879/reputation-of-young-users\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reputation of Young Users</a></li>\n</ul>\n","Location":"Hong Kong"}
