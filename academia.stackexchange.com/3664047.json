I grew up self-teaching out of the Red Box D&amp;D, moved onto other systems from there, and got deep into indie RPGs with funky rules like letting players take narration or having GM-less systems, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I mostly love rpgs that are either narrativist and drama focused, and/or tactically fun.  Including games that do both.</p>\n","Location":"Oakland"}
