Particularly, stochastic processes, information theory, linear algebra, convex optimization, and communication theory are the major interests of mine in mathematics. Also, in case of physics, I have little information about electromagnetic fields\nand propagation theory. Thanks to electrical engineering, Communication System, I was lucky to read about these topics. Currently, I am pursuing M.sC in Communication systems which is focused on cooperative digital communication and cognitive radio.</p>\n","Location":"Caspian Sea"}
