I did this in 1975, with the help of a library book on ALGOL 68, and without access to a computer. Eventually I enlisted the help of a student next door, who took my handwritten code, converted it to punch cards, and ran it on the University computer... The next week, he returned with the printout of a 49x49 magic square - and so a passion was born.</p>\n","Location":"New England (USA)"}
