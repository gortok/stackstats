The ability to break down complex situations into a simple logical manner has always been a natural talent for me. I believe this is what has allowed me to process information rapidly. I was able to complete two B.Sc degrees while acting as a class representative in student council and maintaining a student position in parallel (I'm still not quite sure how I did it).</p>\n\n<p>I began my career as a Software Engineer at Intel. After almost 5 years I made my way to Microsoft where I was a Senior Support Engineer for developers, supporting .NET, programming languages, Visual Studio and TFS.  </p>\n\n<p>Today I am working as a Software Engineer in a multi-discipline environment at Hexagon Metrology and continue to support the community by blogging technical articles and by taking an active part in the wonderful StackOverflow platform.</p>\n","Location":"Israel"}
