When the math teacher was placed to be a one on one for a severely autistic adult, i had to independently teach myself math. he was transferred sometime in the summer of my sophomore year, since then i have self taught myself from Analytical Geometry for 2 years until i was transferred back to a regular high school where i was put into calculus 2 this year. The class is a little bit slow for me so i will be independently studying my own interests while i bare through the class.</p>\n","Location":"Chicago"}
