Software development is one of my hobbies and my pastime job (independent App Store development) and I have many plans for the future.</p>\n\n<p>I'm well skilled in Swift, Objective-C, Java, JavaScript, Visual Basic, and JavaScript, but also in <em>(ANSI)</em> C, C++, C#, Java, Ruby, and Python. I'm also good in creating websites in fully W3C-compliant code (I don't like WYSIWYGs, nor do I like non-standard languages and most non-common methodologies). Although English isn't my primary language (in fact, it's my fourthâ€”as is common in Europe and countries with multiple cultures and official languages), I do try to achieve high quality in my communication.</p>\n\n<p>I love Apple products and other gadgets that change the world.</p>\n","Location":"Brussels, Belgium"}
