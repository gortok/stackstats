I even have the chance to do these things for a living. I am a daily user of <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Fortran</strong>, parallel libraries such as <strong>MPI</strong> &amp; <strong>OpenMP</strong> and a bunch or other programming languages and libraries. I am also a <strong>TeX/LaTeX</strong> user (and enthousiast!) for years, always thrilled to discover all the things you can do with these tools. Finally, I am a <strong>GNU/Linux</strong> user and supporter, and I strongly believe in the power of <strong>sharing</strong> knowledge and culture.</p>\n\n<p>My profile picture is a photograph of a statue of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nicolas Copernicus</a> in his hometown of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toru%C5%84\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toru≈Ñ</a>.</p>\n","Location":"/milky_way/solar_system/earth/europe/france"}
