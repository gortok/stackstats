The majority of my work is focused on freshwater  wetlands but have been known to venture into the marine environment. I enjoy quantitative analysis and rely heavily on statistics. Overall I feel that I have a strong statistics background but can always learn more!!!</p>\n\n<p>I am ecologist with a multi-disciplinary background and can easily straddle the line between biologist and chemist.</p>\n","Location":"Florida"}
