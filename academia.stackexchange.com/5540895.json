I plan on majoring in mathematics, so I am self-studying in the meantime.</p>\n\n<p>I am also interested in the philosophy of mathematics. I am a newbie with regards to this subject, but I am sceptical of realism in maths, especially the indispensability argument. The little reading I've done persuades me to be a fictionalist regarding mathematical entities. </p>\n\n<p>I want to get back into programming, particularly Java or C++, especially studying algorithms and program verification proofs.</p>\n","Location":""}
