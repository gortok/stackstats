Got it half the price and it's a beautiful piece of hardware with the best picure and sound I've ever seen in a laptop, so I couldn't help it. However, many an unpleasant surprise came later when I found myself in a psychodelic Wonderland of MacOS philosophy. No, it's not \"just different\". It's on LSD. I'm slowly discovering why, for the most part it's heritage, but there's Steve Job's lifelong search for identity, mostly as being different from Bill at any cost. See I don't care about anyone's identity, only about the usability of my tools, and MacOS has some serious flaws in that aspect... but OK, it's beautiful. Like many girls I knew.</p>\n\n<p>Other than that, I teach a couple of computer sciences subjects at the Faculty of Electronic Engineering, State University of Nish, Serbia, play some guitar. Writing a couple of books, but hey, no rush. And yes, I'm at the trainer level in Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), but I currently don't do trainings (neither business coaching). Had my time as a consecutive (bi-directional) interpreter for English &lt;-> Serbian. What else? Offroading with a couple of compact SUVs, but that's not for this website.</p>\n","Location":""}
