Kevin is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston in the Levental Lab. His work has contributed to the understanding of the dynamic nature of lipids and proteins in cellular membranes and how dynamic changes in sections of the cell membrane regulate cellular activity and contribute to disease states.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to joining the Levental Lab, Kevin received his Ph.D. at the University of Houston (UH) in Biology. His research focused on genome evolution, population genetics of copy number variation, and eukaryotic parasitism. His work involved bench laboratory work as well as programming computer simulations and advanced statistical analysis of large data sets.  He was involved with many student activities at UH, including acting treasurer and sports coordinator for the BioScience Graduate Society, founding member and treasurer of Students for Personal Safety, and mentoring undergraduate students in independent research. Kevin also worked at UH as a teacher in microbiology for science major students.</p>\n\n<p>Kevin received his Bachelor’s in Science from the University of Houston – Downtown, where he started his research experience under Lisa Morano, Ph.D. and Jeff Flosi, Ph.D. He made the Dean’s list and was awarded a research scholarship for his work on testing the effectiveness of agriculture disease assays.
