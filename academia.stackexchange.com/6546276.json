Social science is an example of a science which is not\n  a science. They follow the forms. You gather data, you do so and so\n  and so forth, but they don’t get any laws, they haven’t found out\n  anything. They haven’t got anywhere – yet. Maybe someday they will,\n  but it’s not very well developed.</p>\n  \n  <p>But what happens is, at an even more mundane level, we get experts on\n  everything that sound like they are sort of scientific experts. They\n  are not scientists. They sit at a typewriter and they make up\n  something like ‘a food grown with a fertilizer that’s organic is\n  better for you than food grown with a fertilizer that is inorganic’.\n  Maybe true, may not be true. But it hasn’t been demonstrated one way\n  or the other. But they’ll sit there on the typewriter and make up all\n  this stuff as if it’s science and then become experts on foods,\n  organic foods and so on. There’s all kinds of myths and pseudo-science\n  all over the place.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now, I might be quite wrong. Maybe they do know all these things. But\n  I don’t think I’m wrong. See, I have the advantage of having found out\n  how hard it is to get to really  <strong><em>know something</em></strong> , how careful you have\n  about checking your experiments, how easy it is to make mistakes and\n  fool yourself. I know what it means to know something.</p>\n  \n  <p>And therefore, I see how they get their information. And I can’t\n  believe that they know when they haven’t done the work necessary, they\n  haven’t done the checks necessary, they haven’t done the care\n  necessary. I have a great suspicion that they don’t know and that they\n  are intimidating people by it. I think so. I don’t know the world very\n  well but that’s what I think.”</p>\n  \n  <p>- <strong>Richard P.
