Doing my first steps in C++ on a nintendoDS atm. I like programming environments that use languages and commands rather than buttons and textfields (e.g. MAKE + CSCOPE against ECLIPSE :) and books on programming that are lightweight and (con+pre)cise against \"for dummies\" books full of environment-specific screenshots.</p>\n\n<p>Mostly did game programming, hobby OS, linux modules and network programming. I did some JAVA too, but i can't tell i've been convinced.</p>\n\n<p>Used a lot of IXP2xxx assembler programming during my PhD, as well.</p>\n","Location":"Europe"}
