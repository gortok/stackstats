I am currently working with the Metabolic &amp; Bariatric Surgery Team at Vanderbilt University Medical Center to better understand the metabolic and hormonal changes associated with bariatric surgery, with an emphasis on the weight loss-independent effects on insulin sensitivity/diabetes, gastrointestinal tract hormonal signaling, and resolution of obesity/diabetes co-morbidities. </p>\n\n<p>As a surgeon-scientist my interests include; metabolism, endocrinology, body weight regulation, as well as graduate medical education, surgical innovation, and reproducible research. I'm currently funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (USA) through an independent research fellowship entitled, \"Mechanisms of Bile Acid Signaling and Metabolism following Gastric Bypass\" (F32DK103474).</p>\n\n<p>PubMed Bibliography: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/browse/collection/40911908/?sort=date&amp;direction=ascending\" rel=\"nofollow\">Albaugh VL</a></p>\n\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAMAAALOAtwB2-pn3czAJP2iRq49iXlUq3oPZG4&amp;trk=hp-identity-name\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn - Vance L.
