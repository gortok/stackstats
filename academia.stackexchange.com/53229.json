I'm mostly familiar with the .NET stack.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the startup scene I was gainfully employed at Microsoft as a Software Engineer for the Chakra JavaScript engine as used by MS Edge and Internet Explorer, prior to that I was an SDET for Expression Blend and Visual Studio, specifically the HTML design tools for Windows 8 Metro/Immersive applications, as well as working on Cordova/PhoneGap support (now known as \"Multi-Device Hybrid Apps\"). My work at Microsoft was mostly .NET initially before moving on to high-performance C++, though I am no C++ language or library expert.</p>\n\n<p>I like to think I have extensive experience in C# and the .NET Framework. Prior to Microsoft I worked on web-applications and web-services using ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC, and WCF. I also have experience in PHP, Java and other non-Microsoft platforms and technologies for which I'm happy to answer questions about.</p>\n\n<p>My employer's legal department requires me to declare that every opinion I express on Stack Overflow is also the opinion of the entire company, of every employee, and of the executive management. I am never wrong and am always right.</p>\n","Location":"Redmond, WA"}
