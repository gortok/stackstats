My research area is that of Functional Analysis. Specifically I'm working on classification of C*-algebras by defining a bivariant version of the Cuntz semigroup, an invariant used to compare positive elements in a C*-algebra and hence infer information about its internal structure.</p>\n\n<p>During my MSc I focused on Algebraic Quantum Field Theory and I have worked on DFR models for Quantum Space-time (arXiv:1211.7050 [gr-qc]).</p>\n","Location":"Glasgow, Scotland"}
