I also know snippits and pieces of a handful of other programming languages -- just enough to be dangerous. I'm currently looking into broadening my repertoire and am flirting with learning Haskell and Clojure.</p>\n\n<p>For more info, visit my <a href=\"http://michael0x2a.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>, <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">StackCareers</a> profile, my <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/michael0x2a\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linkedin</a> profile, or my <a href=\"http://github.com/michael0x2a\" rel=\"nofollow\">github</a> profile.</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
