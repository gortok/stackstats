I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA, USA and still consider it my home. I have a background in medical robotics, computer-assisted surgery, and computational biology. I currently specialize in desktop applications, augmented reality, simulations, and embedded devices, as well as development project management. Since moving to NYC 9 years ago, Iâ€™ve fallen in to working primarily with new media and tech artists doing a lot of interactivity and large-scale lighting installations. I consider my current job to be creating tools that allow artists to naturally express themselves through software without limiting their creativity.</p>\n\n<p>You can generally find me (and a few of the other nominees here) in <a href=\"http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/89/tavern-on-the-meta\">The Tavern</a>, so feel free to come by and chat, or just spam us with awesome animated GIFs of cats freaking out.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>PLEASE <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/168035/display-tag-excerpt-tooltips-when-editing-a-question\">http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/168035/display-tag-excerpt-tooltips-when-editing-a-question</a>!</p>\n\n<p>Interesting posts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/21950/16504\">How to write</a> programs like <a href=\"http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~manuel/obfuscate/xmas.c\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twelve Days of Christmas in C</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/22144/images-with-all-colors\">Images With All Colors</a> - best CodeGolf.SX contest ever!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I just wanted to say to whoever is behind coding the edit history interface on StackOverflow: Nice job!</p>\n\n<p>I'm a serial editor (Wikipedia users hate me), and I've noticed how well the history merges consecutive changes together.
