I enjoy working with Python, Mercurial, and PostgreSQL.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Code written by me during or after <strong>Summer 2013</strong> (but not during the 2013-2014 academic year) could belong to my then-employer unless noted otherwise.  Many other answerers on Stack Exchange are in a similar position with respect to their own employers.  For this reason, I <strong>strongly urge you</strong> not to copy large amounts of code out of Stack Exchange answers, regardless of who wrote them.</p>\n\n<p>Where possible, I try to avoid giving nontrivial code answers, instead providing human-readable instructions.  These are less likely to fall under copyright transfer.  If in doubt, consult your (company's) lawyer.</p>\n\n<p>If you require a specific exemption, please contact me through the comments on the relevant answer.  I may be able to get copyright waivers on a case-by-case basis.  You will probably not get a prompt response and may not get any response.  If I am unable to secure a waiver and I am not satisfied that the code is trivial, I may remove the code or delete the answer entirely to ensure copyright compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Note that there is a copyright waiver in effect for my open source project NBTParse with respect to Google's interest in my code.</p>\n","Location":"Mountain View, California"}
