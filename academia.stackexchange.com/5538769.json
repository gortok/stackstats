I have devoted some attention to the work of Zellig Harris and I am currently preparing some papers on the rationale behind the so-called Minimalist Program for Linguistics, as advocated by Noam Chomsky. I have many lacunae in my mathematical background, but I try to make up for them reading as much as my free time allows me. I would very much appreciate feedback from the people in this forum regarding my (maybe naive) queries. \nI am native speaker of Spanish, but can fluently read in at least 5 languages, so exotic bibliography should not scare me :)</p>\n","Location":""}
