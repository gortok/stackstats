Me included ;)</p>\n\n<p>Oh, I didn't introduce my self: <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/AuhEswe.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here are 8 words that don't describe me.</a></p>\n\n<p>What? That wasn't descriptive enough? Well, here are some words that might actually help: a <strong>self-confessed techno-geek</strong> in the making, I adore:-</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Internet</li>\n<li>Google+  xD</li>\n<li>Open Source</li>\n<li>StackOverflow</li>\n<li>All things geeky</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>in that order. Here are some other links that might help:-</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Email:</strong> Yatharth999@gmail.com, mndhck@gmail.com, YatharthROCK@outlook.com</li>\n<li><strong>Blogger:</strong> <a href=\"http://yatharthrock.blogpsot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Rantosphere</a></li>\n<li><strong>About.me:</strong> <a href=\"http://about.me/YatharthROCK\" rel=\"nofollow\">/YatharthROCK</a></li>\n<li><strong>Google+:</strong> <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115093555862694271963/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">+Yatharth Agarwal</a></li>\n<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YatharthROCK\" rel=\"nofollow\">@YatharthROCK</a></li>\n<li><strong>Facebook:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/YatharthROCK.Agarwal\" rel=\"nofollow\">/YatharthROCK.Agarwal</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p>Oh, and don't forget to check out my blog, <a href=\"http://yatharthrock.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>The Rantosphere</strong></a>. The title is meant to be a portmanteau of <strong>Ranting</strong> and <strong>The Blogosphere</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>But don't worry, most of my posts are actually interesting, if a bit on the incoherent rambling side. I blog about:-</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tech</li>\n<li>Math</li>\n<li>Me, occasionally</li>\n<li>The internet</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and anything else awesome enough to talk about.</p>\n\n<p>You can also view my blog on WordPress, if you like. Both are updated at the same time, courtesy of IFTTT, but Blogger remains my favorite :)</p>\n\n<h1>SOreadytohelp</h1>\n","Location":"Kuwait"}
