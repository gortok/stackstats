I specialise in Evolutionary Computation, in particular biologically inspired representations for evolutionary algorithms. </p>\n\n<p>In the last ten years I have worked as a software engineer, researcher, and teaching assistant. I have participated in the full-cycle of the software development, in software maintenance projects, and in R&amp;D projects. </p>\n\n<p>When I am not focused on how to replicate biological mechanisms in algorithms, you may hear the low frequencies of my tuba, or find me watching F1.</p>\n","Location":"Portugal"}
