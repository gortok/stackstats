My Ph.D (2009) is from the <a href=\"http://umich.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Michigan</a>, and was a joint degree in Mathematics and Education awarded by the <a href=\"http://math.lsa.umich.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mathematics Department</a> and the <a href=\"http://soe.umich.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of Education</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My dissertation focused on the capacity of the secondary Geometry course to faithfully represent authentic mathematical values and practices, and the extent to which school mathematics can cultivate a mathematical sensibility in students.  Current research interests include an analysis of the secondary \"Algebra 2\" course, and an investigation into the mathematics education practices of home-educated students.</p>\n","Location":"Ann Arbor, MI"}
