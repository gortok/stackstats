More interestingly, I've supported, architected, written, and deployed identity and access management solutions end-to-end with Hitachi ID Systems.  I can write technical documentation, reverse-engineer things, write software, administer virtualization environments (primarily for dev environment targets), and run linux deployments of various kinds.</p>\n\n<p>The languages in which I feel most at home are C++, x86 assembly (of either variant), python, and SPARC assembly, more or less in that order.</p>\n","Location":"Seattle, WA"}
