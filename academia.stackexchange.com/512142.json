This includes representation theory of (mostly reductive) Lie groups and p-adic groups, and harmonic analysis on these groups and their homogeneous spaces. Necessarily Schwartz' distributions, Sobolev spaces, and similar things play important supporting roles. I find that a mildly categorical viewpoint is very helpful in keeping things straight.</p>\n","Location":"US"}
