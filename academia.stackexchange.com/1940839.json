I also use tools such as buildroot and crosstools-ng to make cross-compiled Linux images.</p>\n\n<p>Before getting this job I completed a PhD in Astrophysics. This involved a lot of numerical coding using languages like Fortan and IDL. I also used to teach C++ to 2nd year students. </p>\n\n<p>In my spare time I'm always working on different ideas.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment I'm mainly using Python, I'm writing a Betfair bot and also a twitter application. I'm also writing a Blackjack strategy analyser using C++, I doubt it will be of any use to anybody else but I've always wanted to code one. </p>\n\n<p>I also made a Facemash-like website that compares <a href=\"http://www.playerrank.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">great football (soccer) players</a>. I wrote this in PHP and using MySQL. I'm also hosting this using an Amazon EC2 instance, which taught me a lot about server configurations.</p>\n\n<p>In the past I've made Android apps using both Java, and the PhoneGap API, I want to make an iPhone app soon, so I'm going to see about porting the PhoneGap app over.</p>\n\n<p>If you're interested in any of my projects get in touch, similarly if you have any ideas that you think I could help with please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>I also have a <a href=\"http://mathscoding.blogspot.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog</a>.</p>\n","Location":"Morecambe, United Kingdom"}
