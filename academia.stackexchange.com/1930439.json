(I'm somewhere in the JLPT4 range.)\nPicked up \"Japanese Core Words and Phrases\" and \"A Dictionary of Japanese Particles\" for reference, recently.</li>\n<li>Still a math undergrad, about six electives away from graduating. Interested in doing mathematical physics in grad school, though I don't have much more clarity on the matter just yet. Lately I'm most curious about manifolds and things having to do with quantum information.</li>\n<li>Latest programming language to dabble in: python. It probably won't draw me away from perl, but that's mostly just because perl is what I've been using for the past few years. </li>\n<li>Still practicing the piano regularly. Currently in a state of polishing Ravel's Sonatine and learning Rachmaninoff's Etude Op. 39 No. 4.</li>\n<li>Still playing Skyrim, and feeling buyer's remorse over most every other video game purchase I make lately. I still enjoy a good picross puzzle (on the 3DS), though.</li>\n</ul>\n","Location":"Salt Lake City, UT"}
