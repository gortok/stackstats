Previously, I had been developing MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems) and PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) software. Currently, I spend most of my time with Microsoft .NET technologies like C#, WinForms and WCF and of course with databases (Oracle, MS SQL Server). Before that, I had worked for several years with Java, Java EE and Eclipse RCP. I'm very interested in logical and functional programming as well and try to practice that from time to time.</p>\n","Location":"Germany"}
