I've somehow been stuck in the Microsoft stack since I started programming HTML+JavaScript in notepad and IE4 back in the day. VB6 blew my mind for years but these days, .Net and Visual Studio is about all I use â€“ at <a href=\"http://www.realsoftwaresystems.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">work</a> and at home.</p>\n","Location":"Los Angeles, CA"}
