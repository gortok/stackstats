I primarily work in C or C#, though I've also used dozens of languages including various assembler languages, C++, Java, JavaScript, VBScript/ASP, PHP, Python, and LISP. I have extensive experience in embedded systems, Windows Forms, and sockets programming (with both standard and custom-designed protocols.) I also have experience with systems administration, parallel and distributed computing, CUDA, computer architectures, databases, operating system design, Direct3D/3D graphics rendering, and a bit of web development here and there. My primary research focus is in distributed and parallel systems with an emphasis in GPGPU systems.</p>\n","Location":""}
