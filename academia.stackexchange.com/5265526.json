I primarily use <code>R</code> for stats and enjoy exploratory data analysis with <code>ggplot2</code>. I've also begun teaching myself Python for <code>GIS</code> work. I use <code>LaTeX</code> to <strike> write </strike>typeset documents. I guess I consider myself more of a \"quant\" rather than programmer, but I generally enjoy programming. I use <code>emacs</code> as my editor.</p>\n\n<p>When not on a computer, I enjoy reading, cycling, kayaking, scuba diving, and most outdoor activities.</p>\n","Location":"La Crosse, WI"}
