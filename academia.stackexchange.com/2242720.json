When I arrived at a more intimate\n  knowledge, I came to the point where I saw that mountains are not\n  mountains, and rivers are not rivers. But now that I have got its very\n  substance I am at rest. For it's just that I see mountains once again\n  as mountains, and rivers once again as rivers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>-- Qingyuan Weixin</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a\n  sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road.\n  But doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still\n  get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be\n  perplexed, though you will still get the same soaking. This\n  understanding extends to everything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>-- Tsunetomo Yamamoto, <em>Hagakure</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...all models are approximations. Essentially, all models are wrong,\n  but some are useful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>-- George E.P. Box</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Probability does not exist</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>-- Bruno de Finetti</p>\n","Location":"Warsaw, Poland"}
