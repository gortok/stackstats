I'm mostly interested in programming languages and compilers. I think it is amazing to see how an elegant combination of techniques, data structures and algorithms are able to translate programming languages into executable code.</p>\n\n<p>As a student, I have enough free time to contribute regularly to Rust, a new open source systems programming language with a fantastic community.</p>\n","Location":"Netherlands"}
