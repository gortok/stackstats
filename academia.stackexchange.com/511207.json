I have also studied at the University of Kansas, including a graduate Commutative Algebra course. My mathematical interests lie primarily in this field and in dynamical systems, particularly systems of billiards in polygons and the Triangular Billiards Conjecture. I am currently working on a paper on the TBC as part of an REU program, and so far have learned that it makes for unusually poor small talk at parties.</p>\n","Location":"Chicago, IL"}
