Though my posts are my own personal communication and do not represent NASA, Caltech or the US Gov in any way.</p>\n\n<p>My interests are in decision, tracking, and estimation problems, especially exploiting the mobility of the robot to improve estimates. I also study Pursuit Evasion games under sensing uncertainty and the use of robots in environmental monitoring tasks such as precision agriculture.</p>\n\n<p>In my free time I love boxing, camping, sailing, and travelling around.</p>\n","Location":"Minneapolis, MN"}
