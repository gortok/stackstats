I've been with the company for three years, and I've been working with a flight simulation lab for nearly two years now. </p>\n\n<p>Before working for my current employer, I worked for four years as an IT Technician for a college campus.</p>\n\n<p>I've been running RPGs of many types since about 2003. I've been a player, a GM, and a moderator many times. As a GM and moderator most of my experience is with freeform, text-based, play-by-post RPGs. I have also LARPed a few times, and I have some experience with traditional tabletop RPGs. Most of my tabletop experience is with Pathfinder.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also an amateur novelist and poet, and when I get the chance I work on my large story universe or one of my short stories. My wife and I are also working on a book series together.</p>\n","Location":"Georgia, USA"}
