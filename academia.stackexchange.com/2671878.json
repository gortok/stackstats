On 2014 I graduated from Masters Degree in Web Science with distinction. On March of the same year, I had been accepted for a PhD (with a scholarship) in Web Science in University of Southampton. I have worked for global NGOs about Open Data and Open Knowledge, monitoring projects and building teams for smaller projects. Now, I use my mathematics and data analysis knowledge to work as a Data Scientist and Game Designer. How I see myself in 5 years? Working on my own web startup and combine all the subjects I love in one place!</p>\n","Location":"Greece"}
