You really should check it out - visit us at <a href=\"https://ripple.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ripple.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I have worked as a software engineer for over fifteen years and although C++ is my favorite plaything, I have many others toys at my disposal and use them to do <em>amazing</em> things. I have developed just about everything â€“ from shiny user interfaces to low-level kernel drivers. I've worked on servers that handle tens of thousands of users, caching software that accelerates hard drives using SSDs and encrypted distributed storage &amp; backup systems.</p>\n\n<p>My interests are diverse; beyond math-based currencies, they involve next-generation interactive software and <a href=\"http://codelaboratories.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">input methods</a>, cryptography, security, static software analysis, software protection, cloud storage and performance optimization.</p>\n\n<p>You can find me on Twitter as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbougalis\" rel=\"nofollow\">@nbougalis</a> or reach me by e-mail at nikb@bougalis.net. </p>\n","Location":"Las Vegas, NV"}
