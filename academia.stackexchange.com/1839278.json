I originally discovered StackOverflow while looking for help for a couple issues and from there I've expanded to several of the StackExchange site.</p>\n\n<p>I like to help people out whenever I can - so I try to answer any questions I see that I'm fairly certain I know.  This has led me to mainly sticking around the Stack Overflow, English Language &amp; Usage, and English Language Learners sites.</p>\n","Location":"Atlanta, GA"}
