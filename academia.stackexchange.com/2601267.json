Flare provides OpenGL 3+ core bindings, but not compatibility bindings so supports OpenGL 3.0 and upwards, with the default context being 3.2 core. It also provides an optional XNA-like sprite rendering system as well as a 2D text rendering system.</p>\n\n<p>I have experience with programming languages including C#, C/C++, Ruby, Java, and Python, and a passing acquaintance with several others. I also have experience with technologies including XNA/MonoGame, Unity, Ruby on Rails, FRC/FTC robotics libraries (WPILib and the FTC SDK), as well as the afore-mentioned OpenGL and some mobile development.</p>\n\n<p>I currently attend high school in the United States.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Links</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/WardBenjamin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Github</a>: WardBenjamin</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheProgramm3r\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a>: TheProgramm3r</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://benjaminward.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a>: Benjamin Ward</p></li>\n</ul>\n","Location":"United States"}
