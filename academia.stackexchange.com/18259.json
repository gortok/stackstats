I also manage software projects, but never both at the same time. Why do both, you ask? Well, I'm not a one-trick pony. I enjoy both the tactical aspect of writing code as well as the strategic aspect of keeping the customer happy, the development team happy and building software that will Do Something Useful.</p>\n\n<h2>Industries I've Worked</h2>\n\n<p>IT is everywhere! Most industries are very similar when it comes to employee needs, although one might think they're very different. I've seen Financial Traders get just as worked up and panicked as Healthcare Staff when their systems aren't working properly. My job is to make it so whatever the user wants to do is <em>EASY</em> and, in effect, so that they don't even notice me.*</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Business Process Improvement,</li>\n<li>Chemical,</li>\n<li>Education,</li>\n<li>Energy (oil, gas, &amp; electricity),</li>\n<li>Entertainment,</li>\n<li>Financial,</li>\n<li>Marketing,</li>\n<li>Media,</li>\n<li>Property Management, and</li>\n<li>Software (the company's actual product)\n\n<ul>\n<li>Web Development</li>\n<li>Mobile (Android + IOS) App Development</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Favorite OS</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mac OSX is my primary (the command line rocks for unleashing the power of bash)</li>\n<li>Kubuntu for the DT</li>\n<li>Debian for regular server</li>\n<li><strike>Windows</strike> <strike>XBox</strike> PS4 for the games</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Preferred Browsers</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Chrome, hands down</li>\n<li>Firefox, if you're nasty</li>\n<li>IE if you want me to hate my job</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Favorite Languages</h2>\n\n<p>There isn't really a favorite, just languages that are better suited for a particular task/application.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ruby</li>\n<li>Perl</li>\n<li>Objective C</li>\n<li>Javascript</li>\n<li>NodeJS (Angular, etc)</li>\n<li>Java</li>\n<li>PHP</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n","Location":"Houston, TX"}
