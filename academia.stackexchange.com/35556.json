I picked up my first language, Z-80 assembly, more than three decades ago. Since then, I have worked with a variety of programming languages such as APL, C, Pascal, Fortran, C++, Python, Ruby, but my most favorite is Perl by far. Recently, I have been working on gaining a decent understanding of Ocaml and F#.</p>\n\n<p>As an economist, I mostly work on health care related projects these days, focusing on both pricing structures, and productivity improvements. My dissertation was in the field of experimental economics, and I am an expert in applied microeconomics, data analysis, econometrics, and statistics. I have been using SAS since 1995, Stata since it came out, and occasionally dabble in MatLab/Octave and R. With the data sets I am using, the fact that SAS does not need to hold the data set in memory is a huge advantage.</p>\n\n<p>On the development side, I maintain a few packages on CPAN, try to contribute to others as much as I can.</p>\n\n<p>I am available to consult on projects related to economic data, statistical analysis, code review, forensic analysis, web scraping, PDF scraping, XML processing, web site migrations, coaching, and training.</p>\n\n<p>I am a member of the American Economic Association, Economic Science Association, and American Society of Health Economists.</p>\n\n<p>All original source code I post on Stackoverflow and other Stackexchange sites is Copyright 2010&mdash;2015 © A.
