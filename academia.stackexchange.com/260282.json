Usually the posts are helpful.  Sometimes they answer my exact question, but other times they give me a little more information to help me refine my searches.</p>\n\n<p>When I had a problem with Eclipse (a programmer's development application) that I couldn't figure out, I decided to go to the forum at Eclipse.org to ask if others knew the solution.  After two days without an answer, it occurred to me that Stack Overflow has been so helpful in the past that I should post my question here.  I posted my question and about a half an hour later, another user posted the answer.  </p>\n\n<p>Since then, I've decided that I'll check Stack Overflow for the answers to the hard questions that I can't figure out myself.</p>\n","Location":""}
