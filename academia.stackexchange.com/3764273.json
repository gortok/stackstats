On Stack Exchange, I most frequently contribute to the <a href=\"/questions/tagged/d3.js\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'd3.js'\" rel=\"tag\">d3.js</a> and <a href=\"/questions/tagged/svg\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'svg'\" rel=\"tag\">svg</a> tags on Stack Overflow, but I also chime in on Graphic Design, User Experience, and English Language &amp; Usage, among others.  My top scoring answer remains a little bit of absurdity on Puzzles &amp; Code Golf (although it was far from the top scoring answer to that question).</p>\n\n<p>You can find me under the handle AmeliaBR on other code-related sites such as Codepen, Github, or Web Platform Docs.  As Amelia Bellamy-Royds, I'm the co-author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032335.do\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>SVG Essentials, 2nd Edition</em> (with J.
