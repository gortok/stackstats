And am still getting used to the list processing domain, prefix expressions and functional programming.</p>\n\n<p>I started coding in 2011 and since then, I have fallen in love with it!!</p>\n\n<p>I started out with C++, as do most, and worked with it for some time.</p>\n\n<p>After that I discovered python and there was no returning back from there. I have created some applications in Python, using Tkinter for GUI.</p>\n\n<p>I have worked extensively in both front-end web developmentand back-end development. Back-end fascinated me a lot more, and am still learning a lot about the MVC paradigm.</p>\n\n<p>I use Tkinter for creating the GUI of most of the applications that I write in Python.</p>\n\n<p>I also play the keyboard and I love all the compositions by <code>Yanni</code></p>\n\n<p>I solve the Rubik's Cube. And my average time for solving the cube, is under 50 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Some of my favourite quotations are:</p>\n\n<p><code>DUBITO ERGO COGITO,COGITO ERGO SUM</code></p>\n\n<p><code>I DOUBT THEREFORE I THINK, I THINK THEREFORE I AM</code></p>\n\n<p>--RENE DESCARTES</p>\n\n<p>My personal website: <a href=\"http://icyflame.github.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://icyflame.github.io</a></p>\n\n<p>Me on the Internet:</p>\n\n<p>youtube channel:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/007007Delta\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/user/007007Delta</a></p>\n\n<p>Website:  <a href=\"http://icyflame.github.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://icyflame.github.io</a></p>\n\n<p>github repository:  <a href=\"https://github.com/IcyFlame\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/IcyFlame</a></p>\n\n<p>Stack Overflow profile page:  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/2080089/icyflame\">http://stackoverflow.com/users/2080089/icyflame</a></p>\n\n<p>Facebook page:  <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/kannan.siddharth.keyboard\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.facebook.com/kannan.siddharth.keyboard</a></p>\n","Location":"India"}
