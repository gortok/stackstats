At the age of 14, I wrote my first website in html, in paper, as I didn't have a computer back then. Two years later I built and ran a website in php/mysql, before moving my learning efforts to desktop development.\nI'm currently a freelancer working for a few clients and companies, and also on some projects of my own. I mainly use C# and C++ nowadays.</p>\n\n<p>I also have a passionate interest in all natural sciences.</p>\n","Location":"Brazil"}
