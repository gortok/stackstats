I am forever developing my skills in and outside of programming, due to my endless thirst for knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>While I enjoy programming, I never thought I would. When I was a network technician I believed that coding seemed boring. The thought of being stuck in front a computer punching in line and line of code seemed like a terrible career. Then after learning some I realized that it was an amazing way to create things with my logical mind and I have been hooked ever since.</p>\n\n<p>When I'm not programming or working at my main \"food-on-the-table\" job, I am nerding out over science articles, tending my urban organic garden, reading biographies, estudiando espa√±ol, or enjoying the wonderful company of my girlfriend and our furry feline children.</p>\n","Location":"Mansfield, OH"}
