I'm a master of improvisation. I have vast scientific knowledge and unique abilities to use ordinary objects to get myself and friends out of trouble.  I typically carry my Swiss Army knife and a roll of duct tape with me at all times.  I dislike guns because of a traumatic childhood incident.  I try to avoid violence whenever possible.  Because my life was getting too stressful at the Phoenix Foundation, I have picked up programming as a new career.  I spend my spare time on Stack Overflow.</p>\n","Location":""}
