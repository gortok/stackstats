This includes, but is not limited to, assuming I have any <strong>legal, medical, or structural engineering, electrician, or plumber training whatsoever. I have no such training, nor do I hold any certificates or accolades in the aforementioned</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If you take my advice and it ends badly, you do so <strong>at your own risk</strong> and I can provide <strong>no warranty or guarantee</strong> as to my advice's efficacy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>\n\n<p>My advice is provided \"as is\". If you take my advice and it ends well, I am \"happy for you\", unless you are using the advice I have given to \"be a dick\", in which case I am at best \"ambivalent\". I do not understand why licenses feel the need to put \"as is\" in quotes, but I like punctuation (especially parentheticals and ellipses...), so I've decided to \"adopt\" that \"arbitrary style\" for the \"duration\" o\"f\" \"this paragraph\".</p>\n\n<h2>What I am</h2>\n\n<p>I'm a computer engineering and computer science student. I wouldn't call myself an \"expert\" in any topic, but I like computers and am reasonably good at getting thinking machines to do what I want them to do.</p>\n\n<h2>Languages</h2>\n\n<p>My favorite languages are bash, C, C++, Python, Verilog, Perl, and Haskell, but of those I'm only fluent in the first 6. I'm also fluent in Matlab (well... GNU Octave, really), Java and VHDL. And I like Scala better than vanilla Java- except when it comes to the collections framework- because mixins.</p>\n\n<p>LaTeX is also very fun, and I can use it wonderfully, but ``fluent'' implies I know a lot about the language constructs, which I don't, so I'm not.</p>\n\n<h2>Platforms</h2>\n\n<p>If it's an operating system whose name is a registered Bell of AT&amp;T trademark Corporation, or based on the aforementioned, I like it. Currently, using FreeBSD on my main machine. But I also quite like OSX. I know how to use Windows effectively, but that O/S is just too GUI-oriented to make me happy. And, no, Powershell doesn't solve the problem. If I wanted to write DCL, I'd be running VMS.</p>\n\n<p>CentOS and Debian also float my dirigible quite nicely.</p>\n","Location":""}
