I intend to make a minimalist RPG where you can harvest different types of material and scraps, and learn to build new things for your survival and the worker you hire.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also thinking about a level editor to make very big levels with the help of procedural generation.\nAfter using Enet as a networking library, I'll release my new MMOFPS and make millions of dollars. But I should maybe find a job first.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also interested in maths and cryptography, but I don't master those subjects.</p>\n","Location":""}
