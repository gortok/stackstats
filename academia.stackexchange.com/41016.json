Software development is a knowledge exercise, that requires concentration, and a lack of interruptions, to do well.  <em>Chat</em> forces constant context-switching, and loss of efficiency as a result of these interruptions.  I post on Stack Overflow in my free time, when I've already been interrupted for other reasons, but I can't spare the time to hang around in chat rooms.  Thanks for your understanding.</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
