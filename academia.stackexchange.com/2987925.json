I have used LaTeX for a number of years, and I am passionate that LaTeX should become more widely used within undergraduate science degrees.</p>\n\n<p>I am very interested in Rough Paths and the application of Rough Paths to Finance and other real world situations such as sound compression. I am also interested in the teaching of calculus to High school students in a different manner to that traditionally taught in UK High Schools.</p>\n","Location":"Warwick, United Kingdom"}
