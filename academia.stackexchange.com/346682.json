I've done satellite orbit determination and propagation.  Currently I work on high-frequency electromagnetic propagation, interference, and radiation hazard problems.  I analyze electromagnetic wave propagation in rough terrain, urban canyon, and airframe and ship topside scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>I do most of my software development in C++ although I invariably mix Fortran, Java, and C# into my projects.  I closely follow the progress of the C++ standards committee as new language features and libraries are added.</p>\n","Location":"Maryland"}
