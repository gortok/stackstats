I had a bad habit of coding in a language,  just by seeing examples and browsing/googling syntax online, thats how I completed most of my assignments, but better late than never, I realized that this is a problem, when you go into research, where you need to think in terms of language and understand the underlying mechanisms to become a better coder, which is what after all, I am striving for. Anyways, I think I will learn more here, than I could ever contribute.</p>\n","Location":""}
