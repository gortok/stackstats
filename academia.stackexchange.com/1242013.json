I have grown from a junior technician to a full-fledge engineer who learned to take the time to write just the right amount of clean code. Fitting well within a team (but doing just fine on my own), I like a good talk, to exchange of opinions and to share advice.</p>\n\n<p>I love Open Source, Functional Programming, I feel uneasy when unit tests are missing and I have this special ability to always remember why a feature has been written in the first place. I believe that self-organised teams are the best and that leaders should be more mentors than managers.</p>\n\n<p>You will find me good with tooling and curious about every part of an application, server side as well as front end and system automation, no matter the challenge.</p>\n\n<p>I am currently looking for contracting positions in Cardiff or Remote jobs all over the world.</p>\n","Location":"Cardiff, United Kingdom"}
