Just comment about it or flag it.</li>\n<li>Be kind. No one is an expert in everything.</li>\n<li>Apparently I have more deleted answers than accepted ones.</li>\n<li>Answering first is <em>not always</em> the best way, quality ones beat them all.</li>\n<li>Answering in a way which is useful for all future readers and newbies.</li>\n<li>Never miss an opportunity to edit the spelling, grammar or formatting of a post. People don't search for wrongly spelt keywords and it also improves questioner's chances to get an answer.</li>\n<li>The whole point of Stack Overflow was contribution and not competition. Unfortunately, we follow the latter.</li>\n</ol>\n","Location":"Chennai, India"}
