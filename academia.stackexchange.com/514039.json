I've used LaTeX for more than 25 years, ever since I wrote my Ph.D. dissertation and my first few working papers with an early version of LaTeX. I continue to use LaTeX for my working papers, journal articles, and some of my other professional publications. </p>\n\n<p>I am the principal author of the <a href=\"http://ctan.org/pkg/selnolig\" rel=\"nofollow\">selnolig package</a>, which lets users automatically suppress typographic ligatures that are inappropriate because they span morpheme boundaries, for both English and German language texts.</p>\n\n<p>I once edited an entire conference proceedings volume in LaTeX. For another organization I used to work at, I wrote a LaTeX package to implement the style and layout requirements the organization had come up with for working papers written by its economist. This package (i) helped free up much of the authors' time that would otherwise have been wasted on figuring out how to implement the organization's stylistic requirements in LaTeX -- the guidelines had been written (unsurprisingly...) primarily with users of MS Word -- and (ii) actually convinced some of the organization's economists to make the switch from MS Word to LaTeX when writing their working papers.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/1436/5001\">Welcome to TeX.SE!</a></p>\n\n<p>A tip: If you indent lines by 4 spaces, then they are <a href=\"http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/1192/5001\">marked as a code sample</a>.
