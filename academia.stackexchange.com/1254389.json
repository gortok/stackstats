My heart is drawn to topics like user research and design process, but I've also studied other things like data structures and anthropology. I can code, but I'm more of a designer who can be his own engineer, rather than an engineer. </p>\n\n<p>Right now I live in Sweden but I grew up in Nepal where my parents worked at a mission hospital. In a few years time it's probably time to leave Sweden. Perhaps for South Africa, perhaps for somewhere else. I'm open to suggestions. Luckily my wife feels the same way (she was born in Argentina). I have a daughter as well, so as you can tell she does not risk becoming mono-cultural. </p>\n\n<p>If you work in the same office as me you will notice that I love coffee, but in a qualitative way rather than quantitative. I grind my own beans for my french press instead of using the free company coffee machine. I probably enjoy the ritual as much as the superior taste.</p>\n","Location":"Gothenburg, Sweden"}
