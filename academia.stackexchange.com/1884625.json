I also love Linux, specifically Ubuntu. I have tried Debian, Fedora and OpenSUSE, however, but Ubuntu I love the most because its software packages are usually more up to date and there is more free support available. As a general rule of thumb, which may be helpful if you are trying to answer my questions, I always use the latest release of Ubuntu available, e.g., as of June 2015 I am using 15.04. </p>\n\n<p>I have started a Wikia on Ubuntu and Linux in general, <a href=\"http://ubuntu-linux.wikia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ubuntu Wikia</a>. It is currently fairly small, only twenty pages as of 13 June 2015, but help expanding it is always welcome. </p>\n\n<p>I love to create chemical structure diagrams (both skeletal and 3D) the details of how I do so are <a href=\"https://goo.gl/77AbuR\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n","Location":"Townsville, Australia"}
