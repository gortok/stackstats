Just title me (Inquisitive) when you present your problem so I notice it. I see no logic in allowing people to flounder for hours on homework problems that just aren't clicking for them. There is no sense to this because time is of the essence in learning since there is <strong>much</strong> to learn.</p>\n\n<p>I am not a \"Sheldon\". I have good social skills and I will not berate anyone that has an \"entry level\" question. The most important, fundamental questions occur at the entry level.</p>\n\n<p>I reserve the right to berate anyone behaving in a Sheldon-like fashion. Sheldons may be good at physics and math, but that's all they're good at and they are frequently disliked by larger segments of the world population.</p>\n","Location":""}
