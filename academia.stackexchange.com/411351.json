I love writing poems, stories, blogs and programs. I'm a Grammar Nazi and my purist goal is to create the most awesome programming language with its roots in Haskell and Idris.</p>\n\n<p>My stretch goal is to teach children how to program. The system of education countries currently adopt does more harm than good. Hence I want to change the way children learn, because children deserve more. On this note I suggest you read Seymour Papert's awesome book on learning - Mindstorms.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Send me an email if you want a free PDF version of Mindstorms. Also, don't forget to read my blog.
