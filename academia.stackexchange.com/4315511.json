I write internal business applications using the .Net framework and ColdFusion. I am a grad student and plan to continue my technical training after I complete my MBA. My goal is to achieve MS architecture and BI certifications on the path to become senior architect for this or another company.\nI joined Stackoverflow to learn and to help others by sharing my knowledge. I do not always have the right answer. I hope instead of only seeking to downvote, you will take the time to educate me on why I was wrong. </p>\n","Location":"Georgia"}
