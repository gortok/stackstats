Pity I have zero artistic abilities.</p>\n\n<p>Started out in the late 1980s using PL/1, moved to using COBOL with CICS, then back to PL/1 but with DB2. Short while using Toolbook then VB1 before back to mainframes and using PL/1 with CICS, DB2, Datacom, etc. Landed up using Oracle databases along with VB6. VB .NET came along so I used that with MSSQL for a while (and MS Access....), but gently migrated towards using php and MySQL.</p>\n","Location":"Stafford, United Kingdom"}
