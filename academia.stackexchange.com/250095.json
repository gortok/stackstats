Thus I have years of music theory and ear training, performance experience, music history knowledge, etc. Mostly on brass, percussion and piano. Hopefully I can use all this to your benefit.</p>\n\n<p>I've always been interested in music and computers/electronics and often find ways to combine those two interests together. The first program I wrote on a computer in 1983 (2nd grade) played music if you can could it that. Recently, I started learning to play electric guitar and also how to build circuits for pedal boards for guitar.</p>\n\n<p>Hail Sinfonia!</p>\n","Location":"Bloomington, IN"}
