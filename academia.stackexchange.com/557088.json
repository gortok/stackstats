But I stay with the questions much longer.”\n― Albert Einstein</p>\n\n<p>“The more I read, the more I acquire, the more certain I am that I know nothing.”\n― Voltaire</p>\n\n<p>“Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.”\n― Richard P. Feynman</p>\n\n<p>“I think the big mistake in schools is trying to teach children anything, and by using fear as the basic motivation. Fear of getting failing grades, fear of not staying with your class, etc. Interest can produce learning on a scale compared to fear as a nuclear explosion to a firecracker.”\n― Stanley Kubrick</p>\n\n<p>“We are all failures- at least the best of us are.”\n― J.M. Barrie</p>\n\n<p>“Learning is not child's play; we cannot learn without pain.”\n― Aristotle</p>\n\n<p>“Learning never exhausts the mind.”\n― Leonardo da Vinci</p>\n\n<p>“I’ve seen how you can’t learn anything when you’re trying to look like the smartest person in the room.”\n― Barbara Kingsolver</p>\n\n<p>“The authority of those who teach is often an obstacle to those who want to learn.”\n― Cicero</p>\n\n<p>“Real learning comes about when the competitive spirit has ceased.”\n― Jiddu Krishnamurti</p>\n\n<p>“For the best return on your money, pour your purse into your head.”\n― Benjamin Franklin</p>\n\n<p>“The formulation of the problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill.”\n― Albert Einstein</p>\n","Location":""}
