I currently work in Financial Markets and Banking as a Software and Business Analyst. I have a minor in Computer Engineering, which I completely neglected during college. Now I'm trying to catch up. But mostly I consider myself just a hobbyist trying to teach myself electronics.</p>\n\n<p>Things I like the most in electronics:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>To design and etch my own PCBs at home (mostly with thru-role components, with an occasional SMD part to spice things up)</li>\n<li>To play with the oscilloscope</li>\n<li>To light up LEDs and 7-segment displays</li>\n<li>To gut toy RC cars and redo their electronics</li>\n<li>To organize my electronics components into neat boxes</li>\n<li>To browse questions and answers here at EE.SE and to edit posts to make them shine (when I can, that is, but I'm especially fond of fixing equations formatting using MathJaX)</li>\n</ol>\n","Location":"Brazil"}
