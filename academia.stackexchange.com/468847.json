I am an active member of Programmers.SE and Stack Overflow. If you tried to check though, you would think that I'm rarely on SO. I seldom answer questions as I really don't have the knowledge to do so, or the question has already been thoroughly answered. I mainly read questions and answers to learn.</p>\n\n<p>On Programmers.SE, I'm \"Blog Overlord\"! Yes, <a href=\"http://programmers.blogoverflow.com/\">we do have a blog</a>. It's actually filled with great content. If you want to help out or write a post, ping me or World Engineer in the <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2359/programmers-blog\">Programmers Blog Chat Room</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I also oddly enjoy janitorial work around Stack Exchange.</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
