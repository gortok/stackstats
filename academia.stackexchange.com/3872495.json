I got my Bachelor of Music in 2000 from the University of Oklahoma, and my PhD in Music Composition (with a particularly theory-heavy program) from the CUNY Graduate Center of NYC. I've been composing most of my life, but only seriously for the last twenty years. I'm a composer/performer in the new music collective Anti-Social Music, and they released a CD of several of my compositions called <em>Fracture: The Music of Pat Muchmore</em>. I also have pieces on two other CDs of theirs, <em>Anti-Social Music Sings the Great American Songbook</em> and <em>Anti-Social Music is the Future of Everything</em>. Newspeak commissioned and recorded a piece by me for their album <em>sweet light crude</em> and the Millikin Percussion Ensemble commissioned and recorded my piece <em>REGVLVS</em> or <em>Regulus</em> for their album of Premieres.</p>\n\n<p>I've studied composition with Carolyn Bremer, David Olan, David del Tredici and John Corigliano. I've studied theory with Ken Stephenson and Joseph Straus.</p>\n","Location":"New York City"}
