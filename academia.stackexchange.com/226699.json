Most of my professional software development since 1997 has been using C++ under quite a few versions of Visual Studio on the windows platform. At first most of the development was using MFC. Since 2008 most of my software development has been with Qt and using CMake as the project file generator. This has allowed me to develop on Visual Studio but also build and use some of my applications on 64 bit gentoo linux.</p>\n","Location":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA"}
