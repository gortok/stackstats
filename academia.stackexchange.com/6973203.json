My end academic goal is to receive my PhD in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. I am in love with German philosophers and British physicists. I am one of the very few transgender females in my current environment and my political actions have not gone unnoticed. I am a proud supporter and member of the ACLU, HRC, PETA, the Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee. I have vocalised my support for Bernie Sanders and will be volunteering for his campaign. If you wish to contact me, my email is teagengreydix@gmail.com.</p>\n","Location":""}
