In my <a href=\"http://www.uea.ac.uk/che/pickettc/resgroup\" rel=\"nofollow\">day job</a> I work as a chemist, and so you'll see I write a number of chemistry-related LaTeX packages.  I'm also a member of the <a href=\"http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">LaTeX3 Project</a>, working on improving LaTeX with the eventual aim of producing LaTeX3. To keep people up to date with my TeX work and anything else TeX-related I see, I have a <a href=\"http://www.texdev.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog on TeX matters</a>. I'm also keen on helping other TeX users, and so I try to watch the various places that people go for help. I'm also on the committee of the <a href=\"http://uk.tug.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UK TeX Users' Group</a>. So I pop up all over the TeX world!</p>\n","Location":"Northampton, United Kingdom"}
