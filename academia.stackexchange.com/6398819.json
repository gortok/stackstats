I have since changed my degree to Biology, however, I am still two Liberal Arts courses away from full completion. Technically I have completed all of the biological requirements to my degree. </p>\n\n<p>In my free time I love doing a number of things ranging from working with computers to writing fiction to drawing. I also enjoy taking walks and taking photography - specifically macro. </p>\n\n<p>You can look at some of my photography work on Flicker, under the username <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/125596053@N08/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SolarLunix</a>. I also do my own blog under the username <a href=\"https://solarlunix.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SolarLunix</a> as well. </p>\n","Location":"Ireland"}
