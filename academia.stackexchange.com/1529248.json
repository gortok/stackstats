I'm Jeff. Nice to meet you.</p>\n\n<p>I am currently an engineer on Google Maps for Android in Mountain View, CA, though my opinions and advice are my own.</p>\n\n<p>Though I like helping with any answers I can, I am found most often on StackOverflow. I particularly like helping debug and explain <strong>Guice</strong> and <strong>Mockito</strong>, which I count as two of the most-powerful (and sometimes least-intuitive) packages available in Java today.</p>\n\n<p>My five favorite computer science inventions: Code-generating serialization layers (Protocol Buffers and Thrift), Bloom filters, Hilbert indexes, A* search, and CompactHashSet. I'm also a fan of DI and mocking frameworks, as you can see above. :)</p>\n\n<p>( #SOreadytohelp )</p>\n","Location":"San Jose, CA"}
