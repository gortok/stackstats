I've finished my third year, and now I pursue my interests in analytic number theory. In particular, I study automorphic forms under Dr. Jeff Hoffstein.</p>\n\n<p>I happen to loosely update a math blog at davidlowryduda.com. I put a lot of MSE things on there too, though a lot of the material caters to whatever class I'm teaching at the time (this fall, calc I).</p>\n","Location":"Providence, RI"}
