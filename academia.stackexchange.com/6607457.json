I do research and teach in a broad range of areas including entrepreneurship, strategy, technology &amp; innovation, engineering management, and open source. I'm a phenomenon-driven researcher and my focus is on open source entrepreneurship and strategy. I use multiple theoretical lenses and methods in order to understand the use, contingencies, and scope of open source strategies by both established firms and startups. My research contributes both to the academic literature and to the practice of strategic management in technical and non-technical firms alike. My research agenda has laid the foundation for a research that is slated for submission to top-tier journals including IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, Academy of Management Review, Strategic Management Journal, Journal of Business Venturing, Technology Innovation Management Review, and Organization Science, amongst others. I have received numerous awards from both the Academy of Management and the Administrative Sciences Association of Canada, including best student paper and best reviewer awards.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a Professional Engineer (P.Eng.) with extensive entrepreneurship, industry, and government experience. My consulting focus has been in helping nascent organizations answer the question \"How can I make free and open source tools and methods work for me?\". Every organization is different, with different needs and different definitions for \"success\", so I focus on helping organizations map out their unique long-term strategic path to success, however success is measured for them, in their particular industry. Open source strategies can now be found in many industries besides technology and their growth is transforming the way modern firms do business.</p>\n","Location":"Toronto, Ontario"}
