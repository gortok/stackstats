See my <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/138999/jonh?tab=questions\">meta.stackexchange</a> and <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/168703/jonh?tab=questions\">meta.stackoverflow</a> posts to sample this trait.  </p>\n\n<p>I love <a href=\"http://ux.stackexchange.com/\">ux</a> but I always come back to my true love of architecting systems, dealing and making sense of data.  I'm pretty strong with sql-server, jquery, and C#.  I guess that makes me a full stack developer!</p>\n\n<p>I also help my wife with her website <a href=\"http://www.arleenstyles.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">arleenstyles.com</a></p>\n","Location":"Michigan"}
