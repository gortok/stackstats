If you need to contact me regarding how I handled a post on Stack Overflow, please do so <em>on the site</em>. The best option for contact is raising a flag on the relevant post or, if I left a comment on the post, responding to that comment.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I am a business school lecturer and postdoc, and I received my PhD in operations research. My research interests involve data-driven decision making in the healthcare space, with a focus on designing combination drug therapies for advanced cancer and on designing population screening strategies for cancer.</p>\n\n<p>On Stack Overflow, I'm most active in <a href=\"/questions/tagged/mathematical-optimization\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;mathematical-optimization&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">mathematical-optimization</a> (where I am the first and only recipient of a bronze badge) and <a href=\"/questions/tagged/r\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;r&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">r</a>. I most enjoy answering questions that either deal with code optimization or mathematical optimization. My favorite answer I've contributed so far has this flavor:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/31037761/3093387\">Given island and water locations on a grid and the cost of building a bridge on each water square, where should you build bridges to connect the islands at minimum cost?</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When I'm not working or on Stack Overflow, you might find me playing my favorite physical sport (tennis), playing my favorite mental sport (bridge), or playing with my cat Neptune (pictured).</p>\n","Location":"Boston, MA"}
