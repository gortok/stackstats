I have been affiliated with Georgia Tech for more than a decade: I got my BS, MS, and PhD degrees there and now am a member of the research faculty. I get a lot of satisfaction from seeing that \"lightbulb\" moment when someone finally understands a difficult concept you have been helping them with, and that's what these stackexchange sites are all about for me.</p>\n","Location":"Atlanta, GA"}
