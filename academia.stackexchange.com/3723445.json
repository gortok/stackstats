I will be available to start a full time position as of September 2015. I am open to opportunities anywhere in North America, and am particularly interested in re-locating to the United States. I am not actively seeking post-doctoral positions as my preference is for a non-academic career, but I will not turn away a good opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>I am specifically interested in Data Science and UX opportunities, and my ideal position is in the Virtual Reality or Gaming industry. I have experience working with large quantities of data, and collecting and analysing eye movement data.</p>\n","Location":"Canada"}
