I have a keen interest in learning how to improve my codes from professional and/or more experienced programmers at SO. In my work it is important to write code that is fast, but also understandable by scientists. Most of our codes run on supercomputers and use Message Passing Interface, OpenMP and CUDA. I work mostly on <a href=\"http://microhh.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">MicroHH</a> to do three dimensional simulations of turbulent atmospheric flows. I try to improve this code based what I learn at SO.</p>\n","Location":""}
