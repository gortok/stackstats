Java seems painful to code in at first glance given its verbosity (cmp Python / Ruby) and lack of power (cmp C++). However, combined with <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lombok</a>, Java becomes much easier to code in.</p>\n\n<p>Python: Python is my goto language for random hacks. If I want to play around with math, I usually use Python. For random coding challenges: Python. This is just because of Python's ease of use and obvious ways of doing things.</p>\n\n<p>Ruby: I actually like Ruby more than Python because it reads in plain English descriptions of its behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>C++: I learned it over the summer one summer, and I didn't enjoy it much. I played around in the language, and now feel that I am a reasonable C++ developer. My university tells the students who took the first programming class that they are ready to get a job as a \"C++ developer\", but I fail to see how that works. They don't even teach smart pointers!</p>\n\n<p>Haskell: Haskell was a language I dabbled in briefly, but I'm perfectly willing to dabble more in it. Functional programming is incredibly fun. It was really easy to come up with the algorithm for the problems I was solving, but I struggled with Haskell's type system. It appears that the type system is your biggest friend, and your biggest enemy. Still working on it.</p>\n\n<p>On my list to learn:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>C#. From what I hear, C# is close to Java but with much more. C# also seems close to C++. What? Clearly I just need to learn it and find out what's going on here.</li>\n<li>Clojure. Clojure runs on the JVM and has full access to Java's libraries. However, the thing that appeals the most to me about Clojure is its approach to parallelism. I foresee the future of programming to require massive parallelism, which a language like Clojure can do automagically for you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Random esoteric languages I can code in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Befunge (93 / 98)</li>\n<li>Golfscript</li>\n<li>Pyth</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Personal favorites of my Q/A</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Questions\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/28487299/1896169\">http://stackoverflow.com/q/28487299/1896169</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/23557251/1896169\">http://stackoverflow.com/q/23557251/1896169</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/31078439/1896169\">http://stackoverflow.com/q/31078439/1896169</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/q/371972/72616\">http://math.stackexchange.com/q/371972/72616</a></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Answers:\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/33177\">American Gothic in the palette of Mona Lisa: Rearrange the pixels</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/23072168/1896169\">Faster way to split a string in java then add to an ArrayList</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/23557443/1896169\">Why does time incorrectly report such a fast time?</a></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n","Location":"United States"}
