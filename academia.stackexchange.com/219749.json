They face many obstacles, including a giant <strong>semantic gap</strong>.<p>My belief is that if we want to see <strong>intelligent clients</strong>, we should stop trying to build intelligent servers. We should shift our focus towards new methods of building clients that emphasize <strong>serendipitous reuse</strong> of data and functionality.<p>This is why I'm a postdoctoral researcher in semantic hypermedia at Multimedia Lab, a research group of iMinds and Ghent University. I love to think and discuss about the <strong>Semantic Web</strong>, <strong>hypermedia clients</strong> and <strong>APIs</strong>, <strong>Linked Data</strong>, <strong>Web architecture</strong>, and much more. If you like these things too, then we should definitely talk.</p>\n","Location":"Ghent, Belgium"}
