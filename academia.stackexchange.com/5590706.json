Cell and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida</p>\n\n<p>My interests are cancer biology, immunology and biotechnology/pharmaceuticals.</p>\n\n<p>I like to explore molecular mechanisms and pathologies, and \nwhere possible add sufficient extra depth to stimulate curiosity. Sometimes this makes my content out of scope, but I think if you're interested enough, you shouldn't just stop at Q&amp;A: research your problem to an understanding that satisfies you!</p>\n","Location":"Tampa, FL, U.S."}
