I want to encourage beginning students to think for themselves, so I use a lot of hints and comments. More advanced questions I often just answer.</p>\n\n<h1>Relevant personal history:</h1>\n\n<p>PhD from Notre Dame in '90.</p>\n\n<p>Drifted from representation theory of algebraic groups to applications of algebra into telecommunications, mostly coding theory, and lately mostly teaching at college level.</p>\n\n<p>3 graduate students with awarded PhDs. Technically it's now 4, but my previous students did most of the work with the latest one, so I should not include him.</p>\n\n<p>I have mostly worked at our local University at Turku, Finland. At one point I tried working for Nokia Research Center. It was ok, but an old dog didn't learn all the tricks, and then they downsized, so I returned to the Uni as a tenured lecturer.</p>\n","Location":"Rusko, Finland"}
