Using machine learning methodologies to predict a user's position based on the sensors embedded in their device, I was able to achieve accuracies up to 0.84 meters on average in a real-world environment. Read about it <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06125\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>!</p>\n\n<p>During my summer 2015 I worked at MIT's Haystack Observatory on a geoscience project, the <a href=\"http://mahali.mit.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mahali Project</a>, which attempts to leverage the computational abilities of mobile devices for science.</p>\n\n<h1>SOreadytohelp</h1>\n","Location":"Des Moines, IA"}
