Previous work was primarily in disease ecology. Research interests include: Spatial statistics and epidemiology, GIS analysis, fate and transport modeling, big data, and climate change. My preferred tool is R, but can also use Matlab, IDL, arcpy/python, and SAS. For most map-making and smaller-scale analysis I use ArcGIS at work and QGIS if I'm on my laptop.</p>\n","Location":"Atlanta, GA"}
