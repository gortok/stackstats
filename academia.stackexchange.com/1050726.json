I also defined a sequent calculus for dynamic topological logic, wrote a computational chemistry paper introducing the notion of Benzene aromarings, am collaborating with physicists on a black hole physics paper, and am founding a photovoltaic systems engineering company \"SolarCube\". I am also currently writing a book on the Geometric Analysis of Convex Bodies which studies the theory of rectification, the connection between elliptic curves and lattice packings, non-congruent sphere packing kissing numbers, homothetic translative covering problems, totally separable sphere packings, and the Mahler conjecture. I recently received a grant to research Applied Discrete Geometry (crystallography of solid state battery electrolytes) in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Calgary and am starting a Masters degree in the fall under the supervision of Karoly Bezdek and Clifton Cunningham.</p>\n","Location":"Calgary"}
