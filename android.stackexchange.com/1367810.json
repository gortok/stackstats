My mathematical skills are rather pedestrian, with a rare insight every now and then. I have been lucky enough to sit in the same room with some famous mathematicians &amp; engineers. My Erdős number is 5, which undoubtedly makes me as unique as an Irishman in a pub. And I have been spotted in The Pub from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>In professional circumstances, my value add has usually been the injection of common sense and completion of grunt work when perspectives and energies are unfocused. </p>\n\n<p>My current age is the smallest number composed of the first two primes that would allow me to have watched on RTÉ the slightly contradictory small step for man and giant leap for mankind.</p>\n\n<p>My real name is Joe Higgins. Apparently, my last name means 'of the Viking' in Irish. </p>\n\n<p>My alma mater is University College, Cork in Ireland, and I had the additional privilege of obtaining my Phd. from the University of California at Berkeley under the enlightened tutelage of Lucien Polak.</p>\n\n<p>I can be reached at joe dot higgins at gmail dot com.</p>\n\n<p>The little picture is of my tent at Lake Helen on the beautiful Mount Shasta in August, 2009. Unfortunately I had to turn back near the peak this time (on the appropriately named Misery Hill) because of a lightning storm which dumped some\nunexpected snow. The nearby lightning caused my ice axe to hum and a strange bee-like\nbuzzing sound in my hair! Very entertaining.</p>\n","Location":"Albany, CA"}
