As a leader, I seek for <strong>having not only the code done but the end user needs solved</strong> (which sometimes means no coding!).</p>\n\n<p>I'm a little freaky about organization; I have (I believe) an above-the-average tendency to make sure not only coding is done but also documentation is updated and the 'non-code' is also done properly (requirements met, etc.). </p>\n\n<p>After some years, I realized that <strong>coding is only a very small part of IT job: if coding is most of the work, then the work is being done wrongly</strong>! Besides, since 2011 I'm using <a href=\"https://www.toggl.com/track\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toggl</a> to track my working hours to have a better view of where my working efforts are going. If by the end of the day you have that feeling of having accomplished nothing, I strongly suggest to use something like this. It worth a shot!</p>\n\n<p>I'm also interested in <strong>volunteer activities</strong> (especially digital inclusion), so if you need a hand from a Portuguese / Spanish / English speaker, feel free to drop me a message!</p>\n\n<p>If you want to know more about me, check me out @ <a href=\"http://br.linkedin.com/pub/tiago-cardoso/27/b5/6a7\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn</a> or through my personal blog where I share the <a href=\"http://lessonsit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lessons</a> I learned (most of them, the hard way!).</p>\n","Location":"Valencia, Spain"}
