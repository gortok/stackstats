I thoroughly enjoy the \"people\" aspect of software (interfacing with customers, users, etc) and I love working hard to solve a difficult problem.  I have experience in Java, C#, ASP.NET, Javascript, and a little bit of C++ and a smattering of other languages.  I have a great deal of experience with HCI and designing user interfaces.</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
