I used computer for the first time when I was 10 and now it's my primary occupation.</p>\n\n<p>I like looking at the things I use daily and ask myself questions such as “How it is made?”, “How does it work?”, or \"Could I do it better?\". Something that \"just works\" isn't good enough for me. I always want to do the best with everything I use or develop.</p>\n\n<p>Maniacal attention to detail is one of my strengths, but also flaws sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>I like learning and love coding.</p>\n\n<h1>SOreadytohelp</h1>\n","Location":"Italy"}
