I feel like there are occasionally things that have just slipped by that I should know, but I don't and you guys are willing to help me every little step of the way — I love you guys!</p>\n\n<p>I've been learning how to program on my own since I was 8.  I haven't participated in many actual programming courses, but I've managed to learn a lot on my own (and of course I've received plenty of help from StackOverflow).</p>\n\n<p>In the last few years I developed an interest for networking and servers.  I've also developed a strong love for Linux (I have a thing for Debian).</p>\n\n<p>A little while ago I began working as a technician for a small managed IT company.  Since then I have moved on to be the IT manager for a healthcare associated company in Raleigh North Carolina where I support 120+ users and maintain our servers at our central office.</p>\n\n<p>On the side I provide managed web hosting for several smaller companies in NC and have been doing so for a few years.  I enjoy helping my clients improve their SEO and get a better understanding of where their traffic is coming from and what it all means.</p>\n\n<p>In my free time I enjoy designing websites, writing server software, fine tuning my home network, and designing management software for the various systems I work with day-to-day.</p>\n\n<p>My latest endeavor, <a href=\"https://lamejokes.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LameJokes.org</a>, has been one of my favorites.  I decided I wanted to share my love for horribly lame jokes.  I was also unsatisfied with the sorting methods used by other joke websites (I wanted the absolute funniest lame jokes at the top and I wanted the public to have an easy way to vote and submit their own) and so I employed the sorting algorithm described by Evan Miller, <a href=\"http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.  It still has a ways to go, but the project provided me with a wonderful opportunity to learn how to utilize <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AngularJS</a> (and I certainly love it)!  I'd like to improve how the sorting is displayed on the front end (the scores appear rather arbitrary to visitors), I'd like to build a better back end for joke moderation, I'd love to set up integration with my <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LameJokesDotOrg\" rel=\"nofollow\">LameJokesDotOrg Facebook</a> page to auto post user submitted jokes everyday, and I'm currently working on a signup page to have a daily lame joke sent to your email inbox.</p>\n\n<p>I have a few projects up on <a href=\"https://github.com/dlamkins/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> — many of them aren't particularly complete (or any more than just an empty repo), but I do have <a href=\"https://github.com/dlamkins/Trudge\" rel=\"nofollow\">at least one</a> currently that I occasionally commit to (and it actually does something - Ha!).</p>\n","Location":"North Carolina"}
