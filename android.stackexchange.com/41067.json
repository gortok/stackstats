If moderators have access to it they are welcome to post it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mike decided to reply me with a courtesy of posting a message <strong>in chat in public</strong> that heavily distorted what I told him, saying</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>well, when one person tells you ....and <strong>someone else tells you they're coming out of exile just to vote against you</strong>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that this message contains 2 actual falsehoods:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It makes no mention that my message was intended to be <strong>positive</strong> and outright said that I thought he'd be a good moderator in other circumstances.</p></li>\n<li><p>It made me look bad in public by making it seem like I intended to exit exile just to spite him (my message didn't say that - I planned to vote in elections anyway).</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Since I can't clear my name in chat, I <strong>politely</strong> asked him via a comment to clarify the situation.</p>\n\n<p>Again, I chose not to make this public via election page; even went out of my way to frame my request as \"I think this may have been a result of miscommunication on my part\" to make sure it didn't sound accusatory.</p></li>\n<li><p>For doing that, I was suspended.</p>\n\n<p>The suspension message lists the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We've noticed that you've been conversing with other users by abusing the comment feature of the Stack Exchange platform. This is circumventing your current chat suspension. ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>There are no site rules against posting comments addressing specific users</strong>, so <strong>I did not actually violate any rules</strong>. Moreover, no moderator ever contacted me indicating that contacting specific users somehow counts as violation of chat ban (which wouldn't make sense, since chat is public and comments were private). Also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>My comments (or rather me) bent over backwards to be polite and nice</li>\n<li>I didn't litter the site because I took pains to clean up the useless comments once they were read</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>I would like to apologize to Mike for initially thinking he was the one who flagged me. It was not him.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, <strong>he did deliberately escalate a private message into a public smear against me and refused to correct what he said when I politely asked him in case he didn't intend it to be a smear on purpose</strong>, so I'm deeply disappointed.</p></li>\n</ol>\n","Location":"New York, NY"}
