I enjoy researching problems, learning about new technologies, thinking about software architecture, looking for loopholes (in any system, not just I.T.), doing things better/faster, and seeing systems built and functioning. </p>\n\n<p>I also have a secret passion: Physics. While only a hobby right now, I someday hope to go back to school to finish a degree in physics.</p>\n","Location":"Columbus, OH"}
