I am interested in all things computer (windows, mac, linux, virtual machines, hardware, software - you name it) and language (writing, speaking, rhetoric, grammar, style, programming) - anything that concerns these two.</p>\n\n<p>I've been known to have something more or less interesting to say about most things. Hope you came here because you think so, too. Otherwise go away. Thanks.</p>\n","Location":"Berne, Switzerland"}
