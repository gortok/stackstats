This made me jump ship over to be a <em>Web-Developer</em> for a few Digital Agencies. </p>\n\n<p>This pushed me onto doing <em>a lot</em> of open source projects and honing my skills in a variety of areas. Until I eventually landed my current job, where I am constantly pushing the boundaries of what I know and what is possible.</p>\n","Location":"Shopshire, UK"}
