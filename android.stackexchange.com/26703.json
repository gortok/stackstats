My name's Jordan Earls and I'm a programmer. Recently, I've been doing almost exclusively work in .Net with C#, a bit of raw IL, and in some cases a hefty serving of code generating T4(it's the meta-future!). Sometimes I do a bit of embedded/electronic work with C and C++(<a href=\"http://mbed.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mbed.org</a> rocks, btw). And finally, I have at least some competence in Ruby, Delphi, and Javascript. </p>\n\n<p>I currently work for <a href=\"http://preemptive.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">PreEmptive Solutions</a> on the Dotfuscator team and troll the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dotfuscator\">dotfuscator</a> tag on occasion. </p>\n\n<p>Most of my personal projects are open source and BSD licensed. The majority of them are at <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/earlz\" rel=\"nofollow\">bitbucket</a> with the rest of them being listed on <a href=\"https://github.com/Earlz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">github</a></p>\n\n<p>Also, you can follow me on the twitters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/earlzdotnet\" rel=\"nofollow\">@earlzdotnet</a></p>\n\n<h1>SOreadytohelp</h1>\n","Location":"Cleveland, OH"}
