It must be sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is jeopardized. When expedience is compromised by a resulting complexity of user interface, it must present its complexity without unnecessary complication. All other principles must be sacrificed in favour of design simplicity. Implementation simplicity is more important than interface simplicity.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way_v2.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way_v2.0</a></p>\n","Location":"Luna de Sus, Romania"}
