My most recent publication is \"[An Archeology of the Fall][1]\" See website details for further info and reviews.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An Archaeology of the Fall is one of the first truly creative expositions of this unfolding age, described by John Deely in Four Ages of Understanding: The First Postmodern Survey of Philosophy from Ancient Times to the Turn of the Twentieth Century (2001, University of Toronto Press).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have written about \"my personal terrifying experiences in Persia!!! as an archeologist\" My book is now available for Freshmen seminar with an instructor's guide for the 2014-2015 school year.</p>\n\n<p>My personal interests are very diverse: Comparative religion- esp Muslim, Jews, and Christians; Semiotics, linguistics, philosophy of language, rhetoric and propaganda; History; Public health, esp. mental health. Although some of my experience is traditional, I also believe that art and literature are important to improving, understanding and solving modern mental health crises. I have used this with good results for old age dementia, but many find journals, painting, dance, ect very important for recovery from/ treatment for depression, autism, bipolar or other developmental or mental health problems.</p>\n\n<p>Please let me know if you have questions or you would like an advanced copy to you, your class or university! Most is pay-walled as it is quite popular, so please just let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Other info: I am originally from Persia (Iran). I live in the US currently, but I have lived in many countries. I love animals, especially the camel, a deeply misunderstood animal...</p>\n","Location":""}
