Sometimes they skip them because they don't have time to read long questions. I like attempting such questions and I think that could be my trick to earn reputation. </p>\n\n<p>I am also active in many SE sites like programmers.SE, gaming.SE, onstartups.SE, etc. <strong>Send me questions!!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>About me</strong><br>\nI am a Software Developer/Designer from India. Here is my Brief Résumé on <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/sandeepan\">Stackoverflow Careers</a>. Contact me at sandeepan (dot) nits (at) google's mail. </p>\n\n<p>Other than programming I have deep interests in Human Psychology, Entrepreneurship, Social work and Scientific Research. While younger I had deep interests in Genetics, Astronomy etc.</p>\n\n<p>I love computer games, especially FPS games on multi-player, cricket, music, racing and adventure.</p>\n\n<p>I am a 24 years old guy and as time is passing by, I am gradually coming to realize that there are so many things to see and do in this beautiful world. I am afraid that a few years down the line I will repent over so many things I wished to do but could not do. However, I have started serious planning for all this. </p>\n","Location":"Pune, India"}
