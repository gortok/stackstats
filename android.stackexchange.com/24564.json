I also have experience with (but am in no way an expert on) <code>SQL Server</code>, <code>Oracle</code>, <code>Interbase</code>, and <code>Advantage Database Server</code> SQL database engines. I've also dabbled in various other languages and technologies such as Java development for Android, Basic4Android, Delphi Prism, C#, and others.</p>\n\n<p>I've also worked in various scopes, from an independent consultant and contract programmer to being employed by a Fortune 10 company and government agencies (State and Federal).</p>\n\n<p>I'm a veteran of the US Air Force, serving both in flight line operations and administrative positions for five years in locations across the US.</p>\n\n<p>I co-authored a <code>Delphi/C++Builder</code> function and component library (<code>Clipper Functions for Delphi</code>, or <code>CFD</code>), initially starting off as a function library to ease the transition from <code>Clipper</code> (a DOS programming language) to <code>Delphi</code> (an OOP Pascal Windows language). At one point <code>CFD</code> had more than 5,000 registered users, and maintained a 100% upgrade rate for the final three versions released. We had customers on every continent except the Antarctic. I still have users today that contact me for updated versions for new Delphi releases (as recently as mid-January 2012), even though the last official release was in 2000.</p>\n\n<p>Software and libraries I've written have been used by top corporations (including some of the major telecommunications companies). I also wrote (under contract to a corporation based in Dallas, TX) one of the early QuickBooks API applications sold on the Intuit website in 2001.</p>\n\n<p>I currently work with medical claims adjudication software, Ansi X12 EDI, insurance billing, and other health care related software, as well as network administration (Novell Netware and Windows 2003/2008), and document storage.</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
