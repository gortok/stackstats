I'm a husband, father, and son; work as a <a href=\"http://nuwavepartners.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Systems Engineer</a>; and help my friends and family at every opportunity. Perhaps it's best to leave this short, and say I'm someone who's glad to meeting you and hope I can help with whatever technology problems you may be facing.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a Windows and Cisco Engineer by day; but my first passion is <a href=\"http://freebsd.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">FreeBSD</a> and Open Source Software. I <a href=\"http://freebsdfoundation.com/donate\" rel=\"nofollow\">put my money where my mouth is</a> on a quarterly basis. I'm inspired everyday by my peers, their abilities, drive, and passion for competent applications of technology and supporting operationals.
