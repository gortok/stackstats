I then do the back-end development to implement the technical design.  Almost all of my work is with the Drupal platform as I'm extremely comfortable with it, and have been using it since 2006.</p>\n\n<p>I'm self-motivated with over fifteen (15) years experience in the informatics processing industry, notably with Web-based (on-line) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">content management systems (CMSes)</a> for records and data. My skill set includes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_management\" rel=\"nofollow\">information management (IM)</a>, technical architecture and software development. I am a conscientious consultant, capable of working independently or with others to provide sustainable solutions to clients.</p>\n\n<p>From my careers managing a small Web-development firm, working as an employee in the <a href=\"http://gc.ca/home.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canadian federal government</a> and freelancing as an independent contractor, I have gained experience in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture\" rel=\"nofollow\">Information Architecture (IA)</a> / <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling\" rel=\"nofollow\">Data Modelling</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps\" rel=\"nofollow\">DevOps</a>, Back-End Development, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review\" rel=\"nofollow\">Code Review</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management\" rel=\"nofollow\">Software Configuration Management (SCM)</a>, Security Analysis and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator\" rel=\"nofollow\">System Administration</a>. In addition, I hold a software engineering certificate proving that I am fully qualified to develop Web applications, and I have been security cleared by the Canadian federal government.</p>\n\n<p>I have profile pages on <a href=\"http://drupal.org/user/58704\" rel=\"nofollow\">drupal.org</a> and <a href=\"http://ca.linkedin.com/in/colanschwartz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My consulting services are based out of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, but I do remote freelance work for clients everywhere.
