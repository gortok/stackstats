I know about classical mechanics and learning about quantum mechanics. I love most topics in biology. I also am a python programmer. Have already created a search engine and soon creating a web browser. I know many languages (ordered in confidence level for the language):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Python</li>\n<li>HTML &amp; XHTML</li>\n<li>Arduino Language</li>\n<li>C++</li>\n<li>C#</li>\n<li>Javascript (currently learning)</li>\n<li>CSS (currently learning)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I also do love DIY electronics. I like to design circuits and play with my Arduino (although recenlty I haven't done so). I even have a Raspberry Pi but I still need to learn how to use it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/5410448\">\n<img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/5410448.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for TanMath on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for TanMath on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\">\n</a></p>\n","Location":"United States"}
