In programming languages I am quite comfortable with C, C++, C# and Java. Besides these I also know a little bit of Python, Visual Basic, PL/SQL and  PHP. I also like writing shell scripts and batch files.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoy learning about new technologies and gadgets and it is needless to say that I also enjoy coding. I am also an avid gamer and like playing real-time strategy, action-adventure, racing and simulation games. I am not a huge fan of FPS and turn-based strategy games.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from technology, I like listening to music and watching BPL football matches, I am a huge supporter of Manchester United. I am also a foodie and enjoy hanging out with my friends.</p>\n\n<p>My flair.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/4882333\">\n<img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/4882333.png?theme=dark\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for Ayan on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for Ayan on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\">\n</a></p>\n","Location":"Kolkata, India"}
