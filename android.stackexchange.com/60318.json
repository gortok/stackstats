At the moment I'm primary coding in VB.NET/C# and Python, but in my spare time I try to keep my skills up with Vala, QT, Java, PHP and JQuery.\n<hr/>\nIt's not like I mind being downvoted...but heck, I wanna know WHY!\n<hr/>\nYou know, coding is a little bit like jumping from a rooftop while you think you can fly...it seems like a good idea at that time.</p>\n","Location":"Vienna, Austria"}
