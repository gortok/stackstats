I manage Prod, Dev, QC and Test databases.. so I am kind of database guy of our company. And my work requires me to also work with SSIS, SSRS, Crystal Reports, ASP.NET, C#, Silverlight, IIS, Visual Foxpro, Windows Servers and Linux... and recently I have dabbled in realm of DevOps (Powershell, DSC, automation yada yada yada). I like to write, more as a personal journal. In my free time either I am tinkering with new/old software/hardware or building/rebuilding/improving my rig or fixing somebody's computer or learning to code or playing games or making something out of scrap in our garage ;) ... </p>\n\n<p>I also like to test my knowledge time to time by certification, I have following certifications :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MCTS SQL Server 2005</li>\n<li>MCTS SQL Server 2008</li>\n<li>OCA - 10g</li>\n<li>OCE (PL/SQL)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>IMHO, every one should Google the question before asking at any forum because most of time solution is already there in 1st result link (unless you are using Bing ;) )</p>\n\n<p>And yes, I really love to work with Linux.</p>\n","Location":"New York, United States"}
