I know the upside of downsizing, I know the downside of upgrading.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a high-tech low-life. A cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, bi-coastal multi-tasker, and I can give you a gigabyte in a nanosecond.</p>\n\n<p>I'm new-wave, but I'm old-school; and my inner child is outward-bound.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a hot-wired, heat-seeking, warm-hearted cool customer; voice-activated and bio-degradable.</p>\n\n<p>I interface with my database; my database is in cyberspace; so I'm interactive, I'm hyperactive, and from time to time I'm radioactive.</p>\n\n<p>Behind the eight ball, ahead of the curve, ridin' the wave, dodgin' the bullet, pushin' the envelope.</p>\n\n<p>I'm on point, on task, on message, and off drugs.</p>\n\n<p>I've got no need for coke and speed; I've got no urge to binge and purge.</p>\n\n<p>I'm in the moment, on the edge, over the top, but under the radar.</p>\n\n<p>A high-concept, low-profile, medium-range ballistic missionary.</p>\n\n<p>A street-wise smart bomb. A top-gun bottom-feeder.</p>\n\n<p>I wear power ties, I tell power lies, I take power naps, I run victory laps.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a totally ongoing, big-foot, slam-dunk rainmaker with a pro-active outreach.</p>\n\n<p>A raging workaholic, a working rageaholic; out of rehab and in denial.</p>\n\n<p>I've got a personal trainer, a personal shopper, a personal assistant, and a personal agenda.</p>\n\n<p>You can't shut me up; you can't dumb me down. 'Cause I'm tireless, and I'm wireless. I'm an alpha-male on beta-blockers.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a non-believer, I'm an over-achiever; Laid-back and fashion-forward. Up-front, down-home; low-rent, high-maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>I'm super-sized, long-lasting, high-definition, fast-acting, oven-ready and built to last.</p>\n\n<p>A hands-on, footloose, knee-jerk head case; prematurely post-traumatic, and I have a love child who sends me hate-mail.</p>\n\n<p>But I'm feeling, I'm caring, I'm healing, I'm sharing. A supportive, bonding, nurturing primary-care giver.</p>\n\n<p>My output is down, but my income is up. I take a short position on the long bond, and my revenue stream has its own cash flow.</p>\n\n<p>I read junk mail, I eat junk food, I buy junk bonds, I watch trash sports.</p>\n\n<p>I'm gender-specific, capital-intensive, user-friendly and lactose-intolerant.</p>\n\n<p>I like rough sex; I like tough love. I use the f-word in my e-mail. And the software on my hard drive is hard-coreâ€”no soft porn.</p>\n","Location":"Farallon Islands"}
