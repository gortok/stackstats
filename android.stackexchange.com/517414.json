I am working to enter university where I hope to study software design. I have been using Ubuntu since 2009 when I purchased a netbook with 8.04 pre-installed from Dell, and soon after had transitioned completely from Windows to Ubuntu on all of my machines. I love the additional level of customization a Linux desktop has, and scoffing at Windows users and their viruses.</p>\n","Location":"Calgary, Canada"}
