A C#, C++, Python and PHP programmer for that matter, graduated Mediacollege Amsterdam and with previous experiences as intern positions for CroTeam (Serious Sam 3) and a few other Dutch companies, I am an enthusiastic upcoming indie or otherwise game developer looking to set foot out in this strange but amassing field also known as game development.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I am developing my C++ abilities and I would love to take up any position involving said language. But I wouldn't mind to sharpen up my C# skills as well!</p>\n\n<p>The mundane and well established procedures are all fine and dandy, but for me, getting new challenging things done in previously unseen ways and working towards a great end result has always been one of my greatest driving forces. So for those of you who have failed times and times again to find a crazy unorthodox programatrickerist to fulfill their otherwise great ideas, I would be an invaluable asset to have in your team.</p>\n","Location":""}
