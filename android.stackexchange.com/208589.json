Abstraction and encapsulation is really important to me and I maintain a consistent style throughout.</p>\n\n<p>Investigation of the pros and cons that face business needs with software development, ties in nicely with my personal love of new and or proven technologies that directly benefit the business I work for.</p>\n\n<p>It was in early 2008 I realised I had a talent for programming. I spent a lot of time reading books, blogs and manuals and asking for help when I got stuck.</p>\n\n<p>Stack Overflow in particular has really helped me find the right answers to a lot of questions I had, and lead me in the right direction in terms of what to focus on, and the type of code I should be trying to write.</p>\n","Location":"Sydney, Australia"}
