I liked programming and Operating Systems but little did I realize how as a professional, that's what I would be doing all day. Now I write device drivers for operating systems such as Linux and VxWorks. I also put together the root file system and toolchain in order to produce a complete BSP. I like application development and have a new responsibility of writing a portable OS abstraction layer and designing a new C++ object-driven architecture for our existing product line. To improve my team's productivity I've also build a continuous integration and automated test system. Academically I'm doing a computer vision project with the Kinect to position a robot in a room.</p>\n\n<h1>SOreadytohelp</h1>\n","Location":"Los Angeles, CA"}
