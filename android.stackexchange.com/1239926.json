Which is why I always finish what I have started, and I am not content until the product meets my own standards. </p>\n\n<p>While I specialize in JavaScript, meteor.js, AngularJS, mongoDB, SQL, Java, Android, HTML and CSS, I am interested in learning new technologies whenever I get a chance. I also have experience in agile development, lean software development …</p>\n\n<p>What else? I am a peace-loving and easygoing person who enjoys staying indoors, cozy spaces, big screens, fast computers and comfy keyboards. I like to clean, read books on history and make the best carrot salad you have ever tried.</p>\n","Location":"Berlin, Germany"}
