Early 1997 I joined edcom GmbH (an IBM Business Partner based in Munich, Germany, and to the day my current employer) as consultant, developer and professional trainer primarily for Lotus Notes / Domino. I started playing with Xpages late 2008 with the early betas of Domino 8.5. In 2009 I developed a set of Xpages developer courses (long before IBM published theirs), and since then I trained hundreds of Domino and Web developers in the art of Xpages development.</p>\n\n<p>Other than that I'm covering most of the other topics that came (and went) in and around the Lotus Domino family (Notes, Domino, Quickr, iNotes, DECS, LEI, ...), both in development and tech support for our customers.</p>\n\n<p>In the spare time that's left I love being with my family, plus some (but not too much) sport like cycling and hiking in summer, as well as the occasional skiing trip in winter. Not to forget that I'm supporting the glorious FC Bayern Muenchen soccer team. Music in almost all forms, however, is my true passion, both listening to it and playing my own stuff.</p>\n","Location":"Munich, Germany"}
