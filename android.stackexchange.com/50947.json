It was ultimately declined by Jeff, and since he's not here anymore I want to get the team to reconsider.</p>\n\n<p>When there are several comments some of them get hidden, which I don't mind, except when comments in the middle are hidden and I don't realize it till I get to the end. Then I have to unhide the comments and try to figure out which ones I haven't read.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/24490/132547\">See more here</a></p>\n\n<p>Ultimately this might be the best idea.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/55020/132547\">Add a 'Show more comments' button to the top of a list of comments</a></p>\n\n<p>If you agree please up-vote both questions and answers.
