Serious by my standards meant inquisitive or intrigued ... I have always written code in one form or another, but I really, really long for a development job.  I grew up when id Software was in its infancy and writing games was the coolest thing you could do.  I started through Head First Java.  It's a great book.  I also purchased and started watching O'Reilly's Developing Android Apps with Java video series.  Also good.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is I don't learn in that way.  I learn by doing, but I really had nothing to do.  I was approached out of the blue in January 2011 by a Realtor based in NY.  He wanted an application that would allow him to send a large number of people an SMS message.  Direct Marketing.  Ugh.  I hadn't touched Android or Java in almost a year.  But thanks to Stuttering John Smith here I am.  Almost 1 month into the release of my own app I have 1,500 downloads with 500 active installations.  Thank you John for giving me something to do.</p>\n","Location":"Cincinnati, OH"}
