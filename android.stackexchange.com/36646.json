From that moment on, I knew I wanted to write software.  </p>\n\n<p>Many computers, operating systems, and programming languages later, I still enjoy writing software.  In those days, the code might have been to play a tune, a lunar lander clone or even a little hardware integration to turn on and off lights.  These days, I still dabble and explore in my own time.  Whether learning something for the job, or for a personal project.  The last few years of personal projects have involved Raspberry Pis, NodeJS, web/mobile development, and even building a CNC router.  </p>\n\n<p>Over the course of my career, I've worked in many aspects of software development.  I started off in a professional services role, then into product development.  I built software for mid sized companies and enterprises, now I work within an enterprise class company. I have been in management for a decade, but I am now back into an individual contributing role as an Architect.  And, its not over yet.</p>\n","Location":"Phoenix, AZ"}
