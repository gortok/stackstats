I always try to find time to do what I love by keeping my geek cred up and getting into all types of technology. I code primarily in Java, but have dove into other languages to expand my knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>When I'm not being distracted by the latest technologies or gadgets, I try to find time to dabble in small projects with Android or learning more of Linux in my spare time.</p>\n","Location":"Manchester, CT"}
