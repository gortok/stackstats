I've had experience with electronic repair, manufacturing, and testing of professional audio.</p>\n\n<p>I tutored other students in Fortran before PCs existed, built my first computer from bare circuit boards and reject parts (S-100 CP/M system), and transitioned from stereo repair, to professional audio manufacturing at Dolby Labs, where I set up the automated functional testing for Dolby professional equipment.  From there, I went into programming full-time as a C programmer for Mac presentation graphics systems, then to Windows C++ video programming.  My last 10 years was as a C++ Windows software engineer for a corporate source code control system.</p>\n\n<p>I'm now a Linux user, retired from active work but still helping friends with computer problems, configuration, audio/video setup, and other electronic devices.</p>\n","Location":"California"}
