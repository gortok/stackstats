Currently I'm working on cloud deployment strategies </p>\n\n<p>Favorite DB: mySQL</p>\n\n<p>Favorite Languages: PHP, Perl, Javascript, Awk</p>\n\n<p>Favorite Architecture: Linux - CentOS</p>\n\n<p>Favorite Cloud: AWS</p>\n\n<p>Best Suggestions: If you're developing a web application, try New Relic - its a great tool.  If you want to do CC payments, try Stripe. </p>\n\n<p>Best to avoid: AWS CloudWatch - its just not worth it, see my suggestion above.  Lock-in technologies - Amazon RDS and others. Unless you're really sure you'll never want to leave and know the real downsides, be forewarned - simplicity can be the first step to ignorance of true implementation issues.</p>\n","Location":"VA"}
