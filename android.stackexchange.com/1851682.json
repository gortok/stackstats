After 6 months of searching for a job, I was hired by the same college university from which I graduated, as a Junior SharePoint Developer. I began working there in January 2013.</p>\n\n<p>I am working on a new intranet in SharePoint 2013 that serves as a document management system and quality management system. My project went public to all the employees in the faculty of Business and Information management (roughly 400 users) in January 2014. </p>\n\n<p>Many of the questions I asked on Stack Exchange were asked to improve my project, most questions are answered and I even answered some of them myself after trying hard enough to find a solution myself.</p>\n","Location":"Belgium"}
