Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.</p>\n\n<p>It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.</p>\n","Location":"USA"}
