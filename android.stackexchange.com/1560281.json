I18n/a11y warrior. Still grumbles about Javascript but it keeps the bills paid. Codes Android like an old-hand Java developer, which seems to earn StackOverflow cred. Likes excuses for coding Python. Has a life away from code and stock options, too, but Silicon Valley hackers don't seem to understand that.</p>\n","Location":"The Internet"}
