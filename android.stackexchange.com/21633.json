I've programmed in one language or another for about 28 years, and have used MATLAB for 19 of those. My biomedical engineering background covers computational biology, high-performance parallel computing, neural networks, and brain electrophysiology at the cellular and subcellular level.</p>\n\n<p>I'm currently developing image processing software (in MATLAB, C++, and IDL) for a number of projects including IR thermography of hemangiomas, bowel motility tracking in infants, lung perfusion and segmentation, and ASL-BOLD modeling. I have extensive experience with C, C++, MPI, and IDL as well as some familiarity with Java, Ruby, and Lua.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to contact me here (fill in the blanks with g): _novice_ames@_mail.com</p>\n","Location":"Cincinnati, OH"}
