I have a YouTube channel OSEE that presents tutorials for things like FPGAs, Microcontrollers and other embedded things. I am also active on Instructables, posting projects every now and then. Everything I post is usually available for others to use.</p>\n\n<p>I am currently a SW Engineer at Continental for Long Range Radars in ADAS. </p>\n\n<p>Some of my other interests are working out and eating well; cooking and baking; playing older video games; home furnishing.</p>\n\n<p>My strongest domains are Hardware Design, MicroControllers and embedded software/systems.</p>\n","Location":"Michigan"}
