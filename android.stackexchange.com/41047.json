I have years of experience doing embedded software development in C and C++.  I also do work in Python and have gained quite a bit of expertise using it over the last 7-8 years, and I have dabbled in Haskell and Scala to learn the functional programming paradigm in my spare time.</p>\n\n<p>I've worked in DevOps for a few  years helping create ADTRAN's CI process, and now work in their newly formed \"CloudCore\" group for developing cloud based services.</p>\n","Location":"Grant, AL"}
