I am =)</p>\n\n<p>Things I've tried but not like:\nRoR - not for me. Not a best performant engine and absence of control makes this stack unattractive for me. Know much better alternatives despite of all hype around Rails. Excellent architectural sandbox though.</p>\n\n<p>Erlang/Go/Dart/many-others - far from maturity, each have strong sides but cons overwhelm and definitely not for production use at least for next few years.</p>\n\n<p>But let's return to my profile, knowledges and skills:</p>\n\n<p>HTML5/CSS3 modern web UI things</p>\n\n<p>High-load/high availability systems</p>\n\n<p>iOS/Android/WP mobile development including client-server systems and integration into existing enterprise systems</p>\n\n<p>RDBMS including MS SQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL</p>\n\n<p>NoSQL solutions including Redis and MongoDB</p>\n\n<p>Last just finished project (lasted for 4 years) was related to .Net stack (ASP.NET both WebForms/MVC, Telerik controls, WCF and MS SQL clustered configuration).</p>\n\n<p>C/C++ - not actively using for a couple of years but have seniority level in each and actively used on serious projects in the past</p>\n\n<p>Currently actively investigating lock-free algorithms and solutions world, high-performance parallel computing for practical and business needs.</p>\n\n<p>Credo: More fun, more fire in life!</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
