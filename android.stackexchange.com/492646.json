There I got every day a new interesting problem that I have never encountered before.</p>\n\n<p>My next job brought me into project management and later back to system administration - mainly Linux. It was frustrating to manage a project when you knew that doing the admin`s job yourselv would have the current step finished in less than 30 minutes... </p>\n","Location":"Germany"}
