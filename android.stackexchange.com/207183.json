My bachelors degree is a double major in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics. I enjoy all of the benefits of that, such as late-night coding sessions, regular exams, research papers, and all that fun stuff!</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I am employed full-time as a Software Developer, reaping all of the benefits of that as well. Which includes, but is not limited to, busy days filled with meetings, design methodologies, and more coding.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, I stay very busy with both of my lives, it is amazing that I even have time to visit this website.</p>\n","Location":""}
