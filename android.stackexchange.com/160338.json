By doing so that has helped my programming skills as I work on a side project almost every night after coding for my job.</p>\n\n<p>I really think mobile application development is where the future of the industry is going.  Most of my side projects are now related to the Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8.  However, I do all my web work using PHP and MVC.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>I try to follow the mantra of keep it simple stupid!</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm focusing on networking and becoming part of the community of developers.  Not only to help myself, but also to help others.  Wisdom is earned through many failures (big and small).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can also follow me on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/webdad3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a>!  </li>\n</ul>\n","Location":"Colorado"}
