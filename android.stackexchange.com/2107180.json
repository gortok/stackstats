My passion for code started when I was only 15, when I found myself digging into microcontroller code written in BASIC while I discovered ActionScript 1.0 capabilities. Ever since then, I jumped from one language and platform to another, building applications for desktop computers, many-core computers, synthesized digital systems (FPGA's), Raspberry Pi's, low profile microcontrollers and cloud services. Although I love programming at all levels and I master all popular languages, I also enjoy programming in (not that popular) languages like Prolog. During recent years, I've become interested in many fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and have developed flight software for autonomous small spacecraft.</p>\n\n<h1>SOreadytohelp</h1>\n","Location":"Barcelona, Spain"}
