That is why I am active at a number of <a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/10806/torben-gundtofte-bruun?tab=accounts\">other sites</a> in the StackExchange network on topics that interest me. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/235c7dd1f1bb4049ac1e0f6c70b8d1cd\"><img src=\"http://se-flair.appspot.com/png/235c7dd1f1bb4049ac1e0f6c70b8d1cd\" alt=\"valuable flair!\"></a> </p>\n\n<p>I'm something of a Swiss army knife both professionally and in private, able to juggle a wild variety of things at once. I've worked in every kind of business that uses software. I'm also very good with tools, both IT and mechanic. Whether you need software design or assembling some IKEA furniture, I'm your man for the job. I'm generally soft-spoken but driven by clear principles.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a twin, I've lived in five countries, I speak four languages fluently and two more embarrassingly. Also, being a father routinely develops my patience which is useful for moderating on StackExchange too. </p>\n\n<p>To learn more about me, see \n<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112556846578998968684/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">my Google+ profile</a>.</p>\n","Location":"Austria"}
