Lots of experience of databases (mainly PostgreSQL) and quite a variety of programming languages.  Probably C, R, Python, Javascript, Haskell and Java are what I know best and in that order, but you can throw in lots of other languages in there as well.  Lots of working knowledge of TeX, but have tried to stay away from it as a programming language.</p>\n","Location":"United Kingdom"}
