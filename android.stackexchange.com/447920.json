(We often have freelance projects, so get in touch if interested.)</p>\n\n<p>My book, \"Data Push Apps with HTML5 SSE\" is out and selling! Get it from O'Reilly here: <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030928.do\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030928.do</a>   Or from Amazon here: <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1449371930\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449371930</a> Or from any good bookseller.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: looking for another part-time CSS/JS programmer. 理想は東京所在、日本語が読める方。Interesting project(s), you will definitely learn something.</p>\n\n<p>(And, of course, please do get in touch if you have interesting challenges that you would like our world-class experts to work on!)</p>\n\n<p>Typical work: doing fun stuff with data (fixing, mining, etc.), web sites (front and back-ends), trading strategies. Research: trading strategies, computer go, machine translation, understanding context, AI search algorithms. Languages: C++, PHP, R, javascript, and many more. </p>\n\n<p>I'm British, living and working in Tokyo for almost 20 years.

Downvote without a comment (N/A if someone already left a comment and you just agree with it, of course); 2. Answer in comments. Other than that I'm a really easy-going and pragmatic guy :-)</p>\n\n<h1>SOreadytohelp</h1>\n","Location":"Tokyo, Japan"}
