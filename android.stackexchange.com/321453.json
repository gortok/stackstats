I enjoy playing with PowerPC Macs and SPARC Sun systems.  I learned assembler in 2001 but I don't like using it in my work, because it's very hard to get gdb to step through methods that use it (still).</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I wish I could stop working for a while and use computers fully for enjoyment, but (at least most of the time) I enjoy what I do at work.  And at the end of the day isn't that what it's all about?  Enjoying what we do?  I can honestly say I do.</p>\n","Location":"Next to a Macintosh or Sun system, surely."}
