Emacs and FireFox are my preferred environments. After that, I like to throw wikis at problems to make them go away. And if they don't go away, at least we've got the page revisions under version control!</p>\n\n<p>You know what they say about bad code? It's anything YOU wrote, or anything I wrote more than 6 weeks ago.</p>\n\n<p>:::sigh:::</p>\n\n<p>I keep trying to add days to that equation....</p>\n","Location":"Durham, CT"}
