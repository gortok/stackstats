I have done my BCA project which i liked the most because it is really designed, created by me along with team of two more members. Now i am working on an Android app which will be used in the hospital wards where the doctor does the prescription, NurseIncharge administers and the stock consolidation is done. Which eliminates the paper work, and saves time. Which leads to less medication errors.\n\"Working on real projects and learning things by self and taking small help on understanding the concept makes me feel good\". There is always more to learn...</p>\n","Location":"Puttaparthi, India"}
