In the coming months will experiment with LISP by working out the exercises of the Structure &amp; Interpretation of Computer Programs book.</p>\n\n<p>Currently building an AppleTV game with Apple's game technology frameworks: SpriteKit, GameplayKit, GameKit, etc...</p>\n","Location":"Dordrecht, Netherlands"}
