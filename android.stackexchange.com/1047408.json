In addition to a broad range of applications development in Government and private research labs, as well as small startups, I have a long history of contributing to free software/open source projects, basically from the beginning of my career and the beginning of the free software movement, contributing in substantial ways to Python, Mailman, Emacs, Zope/Plone, and more.  I've been tending towards client/server and web applications, and primarily use high-level languages, particularly Python and JavaScript (+HTML/CSS), some Lisp (mostly emacs), and shell, but have recently been making some excursions into Objective C.</p>\n","Location":"District of Columbia"}
