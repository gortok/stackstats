I remember the first time I saw my father make a small program for the C64, it just blew my mind that you could do something like that. Sure, it was only some silly basic example he copied from a book, but I clearly remember the feeling of my curiosity-meter as it went of the charts. From there on my curiosity grew to become more about computers in general. I guess I grew up being a total geek. ;)</p>\n\n<p>Later on I picked up QBasic then VB and ASP and from there I moved on to .NET first as a VB.NET developer but then my current job forced me to change to C# and I haven't looked back since.</p>\n\n<p>What I like the most about being a developer is that you never stop having to learn new techniques, technologies etc.</p>\n","Location":"Copenhagen, Denmark"}
