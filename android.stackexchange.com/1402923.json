If there are gods and they are just, they will not\n  care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the\n  values you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you\n  should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will\n  be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the\n  memory of your loved ones.
