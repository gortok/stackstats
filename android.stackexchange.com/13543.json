My current interests include these, along with rationality, Harry Potter, some computer games, certain sci-fi (but not horror; I can't understand why the American SyFy channel think they belong together), etc.</p>\n\n<p>I started on the Stack Exchange network with Stack Overflow's public release. Since then I've been fairly active on a variety of the sites, mostly Super User.</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
