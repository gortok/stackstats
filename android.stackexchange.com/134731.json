I introduced REST to the organization around 2004 and have learned more and more about it as the years flew by.  My programming days go back to my teenage years, so you can say that I've been at it for some time. I've seen lots of great technologies fail spectacularly, so it takes something to wow me.</p>\n","Location":"Oslo, Norway"}
