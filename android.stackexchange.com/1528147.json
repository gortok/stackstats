They run CentOS 6 x64, have datacenters around the world, and have a full suite of regularly-updated development and deployment tools. And did I mention they're cheap?

No, I don't work for them, I'm just a very satisfied customer. Yes, those are affiliate links, if you sign up then I get a little kickback - no cost to you.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Why <em>Pigimal</em>?</h3>\n\n<p>I sometimes call my <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig\" rel=\"nofollow\">guinea pig</a> (also known as a <em>cavy</em>) \"Pigimal\", which is short for \"Piggy Animal.\" Now you know.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/1528147\"><img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/1528147.png?theme=clean\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n","Location":"near Boston"}
