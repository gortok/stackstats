After completing my internship I've already gained a tremendous amount of experience and insight into the corporate environment. I work a solid 40-45 hours a week, and continually challenge myself to identify and enhance the skills and knowledge I find to be most valuable in my field.</p>\n\n<p>I'm grateful for all the people on SO who have been so helpful to me in the many questions I have. I hope to continue to become a more valuable member of this community and in the near future be a more experienced contributor in the areas of SAP, web applications, database design, and other awesome techie topics. :)</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n","Location":"Oregon"}
