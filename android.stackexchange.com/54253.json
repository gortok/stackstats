I had it rooted and running custom ROMs before it was a one-click deal and before NANDRIOD backups were easy to do! It's definitely less scary these days.</p>\n\n<p>Having since had HTC Sense and Samsung Touchwhiz skinned devices, and always ending up rooting them to run stock / Cyanogenmod ROMs, I've decided to go all Nexus and currently have a Nexus 4 &amp; Nexus 7.</p>\n","Location":"Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom"}
