I consider myself to be a Software Craftsman by which I am interested in well-crafted software using pragmatic techniques that result in high quality and a sense of a job well done. Part of that is using test-driven development where appropriate. Part of that is avoiding overuse of frameworks and/or avoiding tight coupling between business logic and frameworks. Part of that is making the right trade-offs when implementing a feature. Part of that is realizing when one thing needs to be two things (you might joke, but violating the Single Responsibility Principle is very easy when adding features).</p>\n","Location":"Oakland, CA"}
