My core approach is to grow a shared vision, that will guide the enthusiasm and creativity of the teams. To put people in a situation where things get done, I use my simple and time-proven toolkit of lightweight methods (agile, lean, test-driven development, problem solving...).</p>\n\n<p>With 30 years of coding practice, I'm comfortable getting dirty with technical details and finding robust solutions. But the most rewarding experience for me is to develop other people, to make myself dispensable and thus enable the team and the product to prosper even without me. By the same token, I contribute to open source projects and share my latest insights as a public speaker.</p>\n","Location":"Paris, France"}
