Tim has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology where he studied real-time embedded systems and data acquisition systems. He spent 14 years building embedded systems before realizing is software skills were not on par with his hardware skills. Focusing on software, Tim came to the realization that software development has less expensive, faster development cycles than hardware development - perfect for someone with a short attention span and little patience. Hardware development is now relegated to hobby status along with all things in the realm of motorsports. Tim has spent the last 8 years writing software to integrate applications, machines, and technology now with a focus on manufacturing. On the side he tinkers with race car data acquisition and control systems.</p>\n","Location":"Atlanta, GA"}
