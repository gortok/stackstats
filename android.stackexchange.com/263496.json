One of them is linguistics (and languages in general). My native language is Portuguese and, at the moment, I'm commited to the <a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/26339/portuguese-language-usage?referrer=E4RbYe4JA1r7Xdj2Jldccw2\">Portuguese Language &amp; Usage</a> proposal. If you love that language and admire its tradition as much as I do, please commit to it and be part of a great lusophone community!</p>\n","Location":"London, United Kingdom"}
