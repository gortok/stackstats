During the day I mostly code in Perl, with a bit of Flask and Python. On the odd occasion I'll also fiddle with some PHP when I'm making a Wordpress site for a client. I have experience with *nix server administration, including Linux, Apache, MySQL, Varnish, Cisco, NetApp, AWS products such as EC2, RDS, SQS and much more.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also the owner and creator of <a href=\"https://www.foodloggr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.foodloggr.com</a>, a simple food logging app without all the fuss of entering calories. I blog at <a href=\"https://www.matthealy.com.au/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.matthealy.com.au/blog</a>.</p>\n","Location":"Western Australia, Australia"}
