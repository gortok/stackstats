BASIC (BASICA / GWBASIC / QBASIC) was my primary language until 1996. I learnt Java by myself and took my first step into OOP in 1996. At around 2000, I learnt C and C++ at university and they became my primary languages. Since then, I gained my proficiency in both Java, C, C++ and MySQL. At around 2008, I was more into scripting languages like (the more classic) Perl and (the more elegant) Python and Ruby. Since few years ago, I found Objective-C interesting and learnt it. I'm into functional programming recently and find Erlang a great language!</p>\n","Location":"Hong Kong"}
