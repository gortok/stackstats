Not a \"complex question, insightful answer that grows you as a person site.\" People should be able to ask simple questions with simple answers, that just may so happen to be spoon-fed. A lot of people just want to write code that works. Not be empowered. â€“ Owen Sep 19 '08 at 21:23\"</p>\n","Location":"Bow, WA"}
