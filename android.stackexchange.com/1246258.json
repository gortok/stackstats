Currently I mostly work with jQuery and Bootstrap, but I have been looking at other Javascript frameworks as well. </p>\n\n<p>My main work is currently done using Lotusscript (a dialect of VB used in IBM Notes/Domino) and Javascript/jQuery. I also recently started working with C# and .NET.</p>\n\n<p>My past work experience includes working at Microsoft AB in Sweden, and developing IVR (Interactive Voice Response) applications for Esselte Voice (later VoiceEQ) in Sweden.</p>\n\n<p>I started programming in 1982/83, using BASIC on Z80-based computers. After about 2 years, I switched to Pascal, as my school got new Intel 80186-based computers running CP/M-86. In 1988 I started using C, first in DOS and then (about a year or two later) in Windows. When Visual Basic 1.0 came out, I added that to my toolbox. I also have past experience using Paradox (a database later aquired by Borland), Delphi and some Java.</p>\n","Location":"Dallas, TX"}
