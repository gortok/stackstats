I \"grew up\" learning on Java and it's still my favorite language. I prefer strongly typed languages over loosely typed ones for large complicated projects, but Ruby and Javascript have their charms for smaller endeavors and I'm excited about Java getting lambdas in 1.8.</p>\n\n<p>I like learning, and the reason I'm on stack overflow is the challenge of helping other people with their problems. I've also gotten a lot of help from this site so it's nice to be able to pay back to the community.</p>\n","Location":"Columbus, OH"}
