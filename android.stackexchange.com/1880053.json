In Software Development or any other kind of creative engagement, it is not unusual that things which started with the best of intentions end up quickly turning into unmanageable, failure-prone beasts. I'm an agile design thinker with over 20 years of experience hacking computers, 3+ years of those with hands on experience programming Javascript both in the back and the front end of Web applications. </p>\n\n<p>Previous to dedicating myself exclusively to software development and entrepreneurship, I had spent my life as a traveler, musician, visual artist and political engaged citizen. I'm passionate about people and look forward to build strong and truthful relationships longing to empower their lives so their business thrive in a highly dynamic and competitive millennium.</p>\n\n<p>Reach me if you're looking for a professional who can draw high fidelity animated mock-ups, build prototypes, develop services to talk with REST APIs, deploy to some cloud infrastructure or build some great UX with JavaScript front-to-back on desktop and mobile.</p>\n","Location":"Argentina"}
