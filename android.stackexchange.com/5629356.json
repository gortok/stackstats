I love Star Trek, Star Wars, Tolkien, Stephen R Donaldson(Thomas Covenant Series), just about anything science fiction or fantasy. I've studied theology and religion extensively. I've traveled both in and outside of America many times including Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. I went to a top 20 university with a BA in Political Science. I took classes in genetics, chemistry, physics, etc. so I know a bit about those subjects. I go out a lot and am pretty social. I also speak multiple languages. I love art. I'm a curious person who is always looking to learn new things.</p>\n","Location":"USA"}
