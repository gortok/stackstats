Aside from that I'm an autodidact webdeveloper with over 10 years of experience in the complete path from design to coding. My expertise lies with complex, large-scale, real-time PHP web applications.</p>\n\n<p>Currently I'm Chief Web Officer at a Dutch <a href=\"http://www.hostingxs.nl\" rel=\"nofollow\">webhostingprovider</a>; where my department is responsible for all in-house developed web applications. This includes an invoicing, bookkeeping and administration tool. But also a <a href=\"https://controlpanel.hostingxs.nl\" rel=\"nofollow\">webhosting controlpanel</a> of which the latest version is completely written from scratch with <a href=\"http://laravel.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laravel</a>, the latest coding conventions, (preferably) TDD and - as much as the integrated systems allow for - CI. Aside from these, there is a low priority <a href=\"https://api.hostingxs.nl\" rel=\"nofollow\">webservice</a> and <a href=\"http://reseller.hostingxs.nl\" rel=\"nofollow\">resellerinterface</a>, both soon to be integrated in the control panel.</p>\n\n<p>My spare time is consumed mostly by building proof of concepts for website ideas. This includes working with instantly scaling hundreds of cloud machines on digital ocean and google compute engine in order to facilitate <a href=\"http://tournament.today\" rel=\"nofollow\">amateur e-sports competitions in real-time</a>. Or alternatively a CMS security scanning tool called <a href=\"http://cms.today\" rel=\"nofollow\">cms.today</a> with a Wordpress plugin that regularly audits the installation.</p>\n\n<p>Currently my efforts go into some <a href=\"http://hyn.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">multi tenant packages for Laravel 5</a>, including a package that hooks into the webserver by generating apache, nginx and other configs as well as verifying DNS records of the connected hostnames.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/luceos\" rel=\"nofollow\">about me on LinkedIn</a>. Every day #SOreadytohelp.</p>\n","Location":"Netherlands"}
