My name is Paolo Giacon from Italy and since I graduated in 2005 I have been working as a programmer. I have always been interested in computers and, specially, in video-games. When I work I like to find non-trivial solution to the problems. I like to fix problems specially about business-logic and back-end layers (ORM, web-services). Since 2012, I develop in Java and I am definitively happy to do it. I am a reliable, diligent and open-minded person looking for great working experiences and new challenges. I speak English and basic Russian and Spanish. Hope to get in touch with you soon! Ciao!</p>\n","Location":"Milan, Italy"}
