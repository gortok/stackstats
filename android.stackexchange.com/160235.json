I try to use built-ins as much as possible before resorting to sed, awk, etc. Wish Bash would have multidimensional arrays.</p>\n\n<p>I love Python. If I need speed, I write C. I try to avoid C++ where possible. I'd rather run Python code with <a href=\"http://pypy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pypy</a> if I need speed. I love Pypy :)</p>\n\n<p>I have tons of scattered experience with other languages and platforms. So much, that I'd fill in a screen with enumerations only, if I were to list everything.</p>\n","Location":"London, United Kingdom"}
