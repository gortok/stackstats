Van Haren","Id":"android.stackexchange.com-37430","AboutMe":"<p>I'm a programming freak: C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL.  My love for programming runs deep.  </p>\n\n<p>When I was a kid, I wanted nothing more than to be a construction worker because they got to physically build things.  I helped my dad on building projects around the house, big and small.  As I grew up and PCs became something of a common home appliance, I discovered that I could build anything I wanted using the power of programming.  Today I get to do what I enjoy:  build things for people.  StackOverflow has not only helped me be better at what I love, it's allowed me to help others find that same love in a community that feels like home.  #SOreadytohelp</p>\n","Location":"Charlotte, NC"}
