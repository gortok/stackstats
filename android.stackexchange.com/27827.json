In the Holy Place itself, where has been set up the See of the most holy Peter and the Chair of Truth for the light of the world, they have raised the throne of their abominable impiety, with the iniquitous design that <strong>when the Pastor has been struck, the sheep may be scattered</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The most famous Catholic Prophecy in the world over 900 years old</strong>\nIn the final persecution of the Holy Roman Church, there will sit \nPeter the Roman (Antipope Francis), who will pasture his sheep in many tribulations, and when these things are finished, the city of seven hills [i.e. Rome] will be destroyed, and the <strong>dreadful judge will judge his people.
