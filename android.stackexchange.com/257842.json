You can take a look over on Github; I have separate accounts for <a href=\"https://github.com/reitzig\" rel=\"nofollow\">work stuff</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/akerbos\" rel=\"nofollow\">leisure</a>.</p>\n\n<p>During my time at university I have found a passion for teaching, by which I mean helping people learn. Some say I was quite the nitpicker; it's for your best, I promise!</p>\n\n<p>In my free time I play games, read books, code, work out, enjoy music, and roam the webs.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>You can find sources for all self-created images I post on Stack Exchange <a href=\"http://akerbos.github.io/sesketches/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n","Location":"Kaiserslautern, Germany"}
