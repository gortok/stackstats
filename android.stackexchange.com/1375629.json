I revel in being a diverse programmer and have worked with PHP, C, Java, Android, MySQL, SAP ABAP and quite a few others. The world is full of knowledge, and there’s so much more to learn!\nI’m an open-source enthusiast. I’ve worked on the Bug Squad for the Joomla! project, and am currently involved in development of <a href=\"http://github.com/sahana/vesuvius\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sahana Vesuvius</a> for the <a href=\"http://sahanafoundation.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sahana Software Foundation</a>.\nIn my spare time I play rhythm guitar for <a href=\"http://dhishti.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dhishti</a>. I also love reading, computer gaming, watching movies, and swimming.\nTo me, life, with all its ups and downs, is worth all the bad times as well as the good, and I would not change a single aspect of my personal history even if given the chance to do so.</p>\n","Location":"Colombo, Sri Lanka"}
