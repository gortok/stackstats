Since creating my first program at age 12 (a VB6 app that showed a smiley when a button was clicked) I've spent many hours in front of my computer, watching screen casts and reading blogs about programming as well as trying all the new concepts out in my own programs. Although my primary career choice is within physics research, software engineering remains a close runner-up.</p>\n\n<p>StackOverflow has been immensely helpful in my endeavors of becoming a programmer - if not a professional one, then at least one who produces professional quality code.</p>\n","Location":"Sweden"}
