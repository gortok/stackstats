Diversity keeps it exciting and quality makes it even more fun, with my favourites being Java, Eclipse, Maven, Jenkins and Linux, and a new passion for electronics, micro controllers and C.</p>\n\n<p>I think also small applications deserve being developed following best practices like writing unit tests and using continuous integration.</p>\n\n<p>I love to use and contribute to Open Source Software, having my own small project or helping to report or debug bugs in other projects.</p>\n\n<p>And I love to work with my girlfriend on her projects, video editing and photography.</p>\n","Location":"Germany"}
