I got very good at C and C++ in college with one coding internship using Visual C++, MFC, and Direct Sound.   I got familiar with J++ by doing my algorithms class in it, I've done some Sun Java as well.  Most of my coding has been in VB to automate MS Access however.  I'm currently teaching myself C# by creating a utility I hope to sell online.","Location":"Hanford, CA"}
