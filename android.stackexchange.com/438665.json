The time of the PHP MVC framework is over, and now we're moving towards API's and MVVM front end frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind I created <a href=\"https://github.com/AyeAyeApi/Api\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aye Aye Api</a>, which I use in conjunction with AngularJS to provide scalable, robust web applications, rather than traditional page based web sites.</p>\n\n<p>In my personal life, I have a soft spot for Games Development, something I would very much like to get back to one day. My skills cover C, C++, C#, Objective C (yuck, sorry but yuck) and frameworks such as DirectX and Unity.</p>\n","Location":"UK"}
