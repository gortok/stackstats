I love when user loves and excites about what I produced. I love to learn new things, I love constant challenges. I always try to do my best. I love to be a part of a team. I love Chrome. I love Chrome Developer Tools! I think #perfmatters and constantly trying to improve myself about it. I don’t think application is not finished till it is automated tested in a CI env.</p>\n\n<p>I also love backend, but I am not as much experienced as I am in frontend. I love Scala. I love functional programming. I respect large scale horizontal scalable applications and I‘d like to a part of it.</p>\n\n<p>For more information please contact me.</p>\n","Location":"Berlin, Germany"}
