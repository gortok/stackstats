I am mostly interested in back-end web development using mainly PHP and really trying to continually improve my code, writing in a clean and expressive way, following SOLID principles.</p>\n\n<p>I also work a lot with javascript, html, css, sass, etc., but I don't enjoy it as much and do it mostly out of necessity.</p>\n","Location":"Vancouver, Canada"}
