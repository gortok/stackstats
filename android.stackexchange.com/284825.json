Mostly corporate IT work (Java, web/intranet, EAI/ETL, SQL) with some PHP, Perl, and Python for good measure.</p>\n\n<p>My personal development wish list areas are mainly Python/Django and Android.  I'd also like to finally get involved in an open source project in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>I can rarely compete with the Stack Overflow speed demons who answer questions in the first 10ms or so, but I really appreciate this community and all the help it has provided over the years.  I'm always looking to learn and grow, and this is a great place for that.  So, thanks and cheers to all of you!</p>\n","Location":"Lorain, OH"}
