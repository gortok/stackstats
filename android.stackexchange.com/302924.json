I don't think I've had a single day in those three years that I haven't learnt something new about computers. And of course, there is no better way to learn than to do - probably why I'd happily rewrite the wheel to find out how it works. Of course my personal favourite is maths. That's why I'm now <a href=\"http://aal.matdiesel.co.uk/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">writing my own programming language</a>.</p>\n","Location":"England, United Kingdom"}
