I'm the data geek and CiviCRM admin for Citizen Action of New York, a multi-issue progressive (meaning, on the 'left/liberal' side of the political spectrum in US terms) advocacy organization based in Albany, New York, USA. I'm not (yet) really a developer, but am an informed and experienced data guy from my work experience as an organizer and researcher for various progressive causes and many campaigns. I'm an end-user, admin, trainer and rookie developer of Citizen Action's CiviCRM installation. I'm interested in CiviCRM interoperability with the Open Supporter Data Interface project. I'm a native English speaker (well, New Jersey American English).</p>\n","Location":"Albany NY"}
