At different times, one of them may take the lead in developing a particular idea, only to yield to the other subject as focus shifts. But altogether, the two interact in a virtuous circle of mutual influence.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>—Edward Frenkel</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>—Albert Einstein</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One cannot escape the feeling that these mathematical formulas have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are wiser than we are, wiser even than their discoverers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>—Heinrich Hertz</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you are receptive and humble, mathematics will lead you by the hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>—Paul Dirac</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I did not, however, commit suicide, because I wished to know more of mathematics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>—Bertrand Russell</em></p>\n","Location":""}
