I also dabbled some in Java, Ruby, and R.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite languages are Python and JavaScript, as they are far more expressive and more fun to write. However, prior to both languages, I am deeply rooted in C/C++ and C#.</p>\n\n<p>As a former Microsoftie, I worked as a software design engineer in test. My test focus was the server platform behind Microsoft Windows Live Messenger (now merged in Skype), as well as Address Book for Microsoft Hotmail (now powers People app in Windows 8)</p>\n\n<p>My current focus is actually as a back-end financial analyst in black box trading.</p>\n","Location":"Houston, TX"}
