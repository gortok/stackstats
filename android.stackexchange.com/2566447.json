I’m Mitch. I’m 18 years old and I love to code! I live <em>for</em> code, and I live <em>to</em> code! I’m very interested in programming in many different forms; from front-end design to back-end design, from PCs to Macs, and from computers to electronics; I love it all!</p>\n\n<p>I’m a very determined and passionate person, and I think of my programming projects as intricate puzzles that can always be solved as long as I’m willing to put forth the effort (and I am!). I am a perfectionist and will tweak the fine details of my code to ensure that the code not only works, but is simple and concise. I believe that code should not only work well, but look good too! When coding, I prefer to do things the right way rather than the easy way, and I will often push the boundaries of my programming knowledge to challenge myself to learn more!</p>\n\n<p>#SOreadytohelp</p>\n","Location":""}
