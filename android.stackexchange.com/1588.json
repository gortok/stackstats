After the web started taking off, I began fooling around with HTML in my spare time.  Eventually, I enjoyed it so much that I made web design/programming/administration my full-time job.  I freelance for a bunch of clients because it lets me dip my toes in a ton of different technologies and business models.</p>\n","Location":"New Jersey"}
