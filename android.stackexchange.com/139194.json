I work mostly with .Net and C#, focusing on IPv4 networking and protocols, high-performance multi-threading, parallelization and software architecture. I do a lot of network programming (I wrote an OSPF router implementation), and I do also tend to dabble in small-scale systems administration, networking, and routing, often working with FreeBSD.</p>\n","Location":"Rochester, NY"}
