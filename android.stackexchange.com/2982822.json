I am very good at what I do and I very much enjoy it. During my years working for Freedom Scientific I have had the pleasure of working on products that truly make a difference in people's lives. Freedom Scientific develops a number of assistive technology products for those who are blind, have low vision, or have learning disabilities. I have worked on several of the products developed by Freedom Scientific including <a href=\"http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/fs/JAWS-product-page.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">JAWS</a>, <a href=\"http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/lv/magic-bl-product-page.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">MAGic</a>, <a href=\"http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/fs/OpenBook-product-page.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenBook</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/fs/pacmate-product-page.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">PAC Mate</a>. Most recently I have worked on MAGic.</p>\n\n<p>My primary programming language is C++ but I have dabbled in Java, Python, and TCL. Most of the software I have worked on runs only under Microsoft Windows but I have dabbled in programming for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, and Solaris.</p>\n\n<p>I have published several open source projects on my <a href=\"https://svn.sullivanandkey.com/SnKOpen/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SnKOpen</a> SVN repository. One of these projects, the <a href=\"https://svn.sullivanandkey.com/SnKOpen/cpp/yekneb/trunk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">YekNeb C++ Code snippets library</a> compiles under Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, and Solaris.</p>\n","Location":"Austin, TX"}
