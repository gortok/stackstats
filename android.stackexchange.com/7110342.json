Worked with Crystal Reports and Oracle for a number of years until I began my experience with SQL 2008 and warehousing; since then, I've developed data warehouses, administrated databases, Analysis Services cubes, Reporting Services reports, and spent a little time with Tableau.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I am a DBA who is part of a team administrating 4 different deployment environments that total in 1,500 databases on a little over 100 instances. I use tools such as LiteSpeed, Ignite, and Spotlight on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoy small companies where there is passion, environmentally social, and exciting.</p>\n","Location":"KCMO"}
