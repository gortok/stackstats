In his <a href=\"http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/technology/web/staff/afranco\" rel=\"nofollow\">work for Middlebury College</a> Adam led the development of the <a href=\"https://segue.middlebury.edu/sites/segue\" rel=\"nofollow\">Segue</a> learning management system and the <a href=\"http://harmoni.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harmoni</a> application framework before moving on to building and enhancing a wide range of web applications. Recently Adam has been developing curricular and administrative applications based on the Drupal platform with a focus on high-performance and high-availability application deployments.</p>\n\n<p>Long a proponent of open-source software development, Adam has contributed to a number of open-source projects including the <a href=\"http://www.okiproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Knowledge Initiative (O.K.I.)</a> OSID standards, <a href=\"http://www.jasig.org/cas\" rel=\"nofollow\">CAS</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASC/phpCAS\" rel=\"nofollow\">phpCAS</a>, and a number of Drupal and WordPress modules.</p>\n\n<p>When not creating virtual systems Adam enjoys designing and creating things in the physical world -- from <a href=\"http://www.adamfranco.com/tag/woodworking/\" rel=\"nofollow\">wood furniture</a> to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamfranco/\" rel=\"nofollow\">photography</a>.
