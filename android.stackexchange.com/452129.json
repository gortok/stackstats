Having no college education I began teaching myself software development around 1997, when I first started with C/C++. Although early on I dabbled in x86 assembly, Visual Basic, and ASP, my professional experience is currently with PHP and Java (along with the related web technologies such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript, jQuery, JSP/JSTL, and Spring).</p>\n\n<p>I currently run my own software development company called <a href=\"http://www.awnry.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Awnry Software</a>, which produces the <a href=\"http://naw.awnry.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">News &amp; Weather app</a> for Android&trade;, provides freelance and consulting services to small businesses, and contributes to a number of open source projects, such as my <a href=\"http://plugins.jquery.com/picklist/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>jquery-picklist</code> plugin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Until very recently I was working as a \"real-time Java Solutions Developer\" at <a href=\"http://acxiom.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acxiom Corporation</a>, a leading \"enterprise data, analytics and software-as-a-service company.\" My team used Java and related technologies to build and maintain real-time solutions &mdash; specifically web-based apps and services &mdash; for the company's many clients. At the end of October 2013 I left the company to focus on my projects at <a href=\"http://www.awnry.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Awnry Software</a>; specifically the <a href=\"http://naw.awnry.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">News &amp; Weather app</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Still learning lots of new things everyday, I think the moment you believe you have nothing left to learn, you should probably go ahead and retire or find another discipline. I strive for best practices in whatever I do, but I'm also pragmatic when and where it's necessary.</p>\n","Location":"Conway, AR"}
