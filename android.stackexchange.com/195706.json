I intend to specialize in Machine Learning techniques for large scale data. Usually I use C/C++ and occasionally Java to code along with Matlab. Of lately I have been fiddling around with Python, which seems to have brought back the \"fun\" part in programming.</p>\n","Location":"Bangalore, India"}
