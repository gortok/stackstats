That computer delivered less performance than your microwave clock now does, yet it was so much fun. \nNowadays I enjoy using C++14, JavaScript and Python. I am also very enthusiastic about open source, Linux and free (as in free speech) software. For living I build electronic trading systems.\nI am looking for top 1% developers in London for top pay.</p>\n","Location":"London, United Kingdom"}
