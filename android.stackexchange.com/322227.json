I mostly wrote games at this point.</p>\n\n<p>To cut a long story short I got BSc in Applied Computing in 1995 from the University of East Anglia in Norwich, with a final year project in connecting a website to a database using cgi scripts written in C, and eventually started a career as a web programmer, mostly for internal intranet systems and currently a software as a service web and ivr survey system, mostly working on the reporting side of things.  </p>\n","Location":"United Kingdom"}
