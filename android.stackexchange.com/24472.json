In the past that has included html/css/javascript, php, c, objective c, as3/flex, perl, python, and (we're going <em>way</em> back, now) coldfusion.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I play with whatever looks interesting at the time, including lua, ruby, and game development frameworks like moai, corona and unity.</p>\n\n<p>Most recently, over the past two years, I gleefully lept into a rigorous trial by fire, taking javascript and the html dom to places that I didn't know were possible.</p>\n","Location":"New Jersey"}
