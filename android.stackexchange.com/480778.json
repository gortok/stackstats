Later I discovered science, specifically Astronomy and Astrophysics and that's what I do now. I create simulations of extra-solar planet transits. Awesome, isn't it?</p>\n\n<p>I love Open Source and Free Software and when I make something cool or something useful to others I always share it. I enjoy contributing to other projects and whenever I have time or if I stumble upon a bug or a security issue, I will always debug it, fork the repo and fix it.</p>\n\n<p>Check out my newest project: <a href=\"https://hacktag.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">#hacktag</a></p>\n","Location":"United Kingdom"}
