I have spent most of my professional career in localization and worked in small translation agencies to large enterprise. My positions have more commonly been on the technical and consulting side of localization.</p>\n\n<p>I currently run Globalme Language &amp; Technology which I co-founded. Globalme is a language solutions provider. If you ask \"what kind of solution a language could require?\", that most likely means you have not met with localization. You will know when you do and that's the time you want to contact Globalme.</p>\n\n<p>My main responsibility at Globalme is developing the strategy for our technology offerings and the company vision.</p>\n","Location":"Vancouver, BC"}
