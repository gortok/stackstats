Most recently focussed on a bespoke warehouse management system using C# 3.5 and SQL Server 2008.</p>\n\n<p>Since my move to .NET I've become active in the community, attending monthly usergroup meetings and various conferences. I've even made a foray into speaking at usergroups about topics I am passionate about.</p>\n\n<p>While I love experimenting with new tech and have a hobby project hosted on CodePlex, my current focus is less on specific new technologies and more on good principles and techniques.</p>\n\n<p>When not at work I'm a family man, biker, amateur photographer, guitarist and of course, software developer.</p>\n","Location":"Midlands, UK"}
