I'm Austin Burk (Sudofox), a programmer, poet, brony, Christian, creator, brainstormer, hacker, obsessive bicyclist, and more! I made a site called <a href=\"http://www.sudomemo.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sudomemo</a>. That's a whole other story. \nI'm a system administrator at LiquidWeb, a web hosting company based in Lansing, MI. Somehow I'm a people person <em>and</em> a programmer <em>and</em> a writer. God has blessed me with some wonderful talents and I hope to develop them into something pleasing to Him.</p>\n","Location":"Haslett, MI"}
