My first computer was the commodore 64 and that's where I really grew to love technology, computers, and video games.</p>\n\n<p>I mostly just self taught myself about computers and would spend every last earned dime, combined with Christmas/birthday gifts to build my PC and continue upgrading it.</p>\n\n<p>Later in life I went to school at Full Sail University where I met some of the coolest people ever and learned how hard making video games really is. I also learned how to program, and how to learn pretty much anything I put my mind to in a very short period of time. That is probably the greatest skill I got out of college.</p>\n\n<p>I've worked in the games industry , technical support, and now automation. I really enjoy anything that provides me with a challenge and keeps me learning new things. I really do believe the statement that you never stop being a student.</p>\n","Location":"Raleigh, NC"}
