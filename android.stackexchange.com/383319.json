After 30 years of constantly expanding computing power, it's fascinating to return to a restrictive environment where you not only need to be concerned about limited memory and processing power, but conserving battery charge as well.</p>\n\n<p>My rusty Java skills make this hobby even more interesting, as does the switch back and forth between high-level MATLAB and lower-level Java.</p>\n","Location":""}
