Minor \"fun\" developing projects done before that.</p>\n\n<p>Experienced mostly in Java, PHP and Python. But you can throw pretty much anything else at me. Chances that I've written a small application in it is high. Lua? Lisp? Clips? Blaise? SAS? and many more in my repertoire!</p>\n\n<p>Apart from software development, I have a very good knowledge of Linux server administration.</p>\n\n<p>Dedicated VIM and Linux user.</p>\n\n<p>Any questions?</p>\n","Location":"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg"}
