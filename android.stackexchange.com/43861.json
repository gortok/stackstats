These days, I'm a senior software engineer at Google, currently working on Java application server infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Besides being fluent in English and American Sign Language, I know too many programming languages to count. Lately I've primarily been using Java, plus some odds and ends of Python, C++, and JavaScript. I enjoy C#, even though nowadays I don't get many chances to use it. I'm also a big fan of Haskell and Scala, although I haven't had a chance to use either of them in a large-scale project yet.</p>\n\n<p>In my spare time, I play guitar and read voraciously, including science fiction and books on computing. I'm also a volunteer minister for the deaf, teaching Bible studies in American Sign Language.</p>\n\n<p>I love answering programming questions -- both on Stack Overflow and elsewhere. (If you're inside Google's network, look me up. I'm especially happy to answer questions about Java, Guice, and application server frameworks.)</p>\n\n<p><em>Standard disclaimer: my opinions are my own, and not necessarily those of my employer.</em></p>\n","Location":"Silicon Valley"}
