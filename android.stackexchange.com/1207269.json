Then I start to ask the hard questions. Like why Victor Brett's <a href=\"http://worrydream.com/#!/InventingOnPrinciple\" rel=\"nofollow\">ideas</a> are not everyday reality yet? <em>(Unfortunately I know the answer to that one.)</em></p>\n\n<p>I like the ideas in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Weinberg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gerald Weingerg</a>'s books. I like to keep myself updated about JavaScript, CSS, Python, Perl, Excel, NLP, Testing and stuff - I don't remember it all, but that's what google is for. And I like to read a good SF every now and then.</p>\n","Location":"Cambridge, United Kingdom"}
