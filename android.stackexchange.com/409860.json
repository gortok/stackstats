America is made up of immigrants... if your children are to be successful they must act like immigrants in their own country. Just by being born here doesn't give you the ability to be successful... it is the work ethic... the pioneering ethic... the service ethic that will win. Your competition is always a hungry immigrant with a digital assistant: hungry in the belly for food, hungry in the mind for knowledge, and the hunger is something that should never leave you.\"</p>\n\n<p>~Dr. Dennis Waitley</p>\n","Location":"Nebraska"}
