The course load is rather difficult, but I enjoy it nonetheless.  I enjoy programming in my spare time.  I have a ton of side projects, many of which I haven't ever finished.  My language of choice is C#.  I've been using C# since I was 12-13.  Aside from C#, I also have experience in Java, C/C++, perl, python, HTML/CSS, javascript, and some VB.Net.  </p>\n\n<p>Outside of the programming world, I also heavily enjoy music.  It's one of my favorite things.  I listen to essentially everything.  At the last check, I had about 80 genres in my collection.</p>\n\n<p>I love technology, especially in the mobile sense.  I think all of the advancements brought by Apple, Google, Microsoft, Palm, and the others are phenomenal.  I have a Nexus 4 and love it to death.  Every day, I find new things I can do with it.  Aside from that, I find it really cool to develop on mobile platforms.</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
