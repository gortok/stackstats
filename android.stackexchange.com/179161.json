From a young age I have always looked forward to new technologies.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen first-hand how the Internet has grown and evolved. From plain hypertext to the internet of services and cloud computing. I grew up along with the Internet, I have been learning Web tech and programming for more than 15 years.</p>\n\n<p>I am self-taught but an enthusiast and big fan of Computer Science, this has led me to learn and challenge myself every day. I understand Software as more than just code, it is creativity and innovation and a great opportunity to share knowledge with other professionals.</p>\n\n<p>After all, the tool does not make the professional. My principle is \"enthusiasts do great things\". A tool is just a possible expression of some valid solution to get things done right!</p>\n\n<p>What am I looking for? I am committed to grow, share, build, create and innovate. At the end of the day, to learn and enjoy.</p>\n","Location":"Barcelona, Spain"}
