At work I am creating reasoning algorithms to extract information from raw data (like empirical test, brains) and transfer these to decision rules, or other classification methods. The algorithms I've researched, and developed, are being 'grouped' in a single \"organismic\" reasoning entity.\nThereafter I focused on bioinformatics to create a network of information on the working of the human system.\nIn free time, I'm creating an Android interface for a NewsApp.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers</p>\n","Location":"The Netherlands"}
