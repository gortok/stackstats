If you're reading this, I haven't died yet.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, how would you know? I mean, how could I possibly delete this message after my own demise?</p>\n\n<p>You know what? Just go ahead and assume I'm dead. Any posts appearing to be made by me are from an impostor who's stolen my identity post-mortem, and only further prove the fact that I am dead. After all, why would I even think to post a canary message if I was expecting to be alive to remove it anyway?</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I'm still not the droid you're looking for.</p>\n","Location":"Florida"}
