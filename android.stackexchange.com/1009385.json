During my college life, I almost completed 200 freelance projects, majority of them were written in my favorite language of all. Speaking about that, PHP is literally the third language I speak after Hindi and English. Currently at work using PHP is generally discouraged, but we can use it to make internal apps. Since I feel much much much comfortable writing code in PHP I built all my projects in PHP. These projects might be seeing a global roll-out soon.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from working on new projects and helping out my blog readers, I love teaching whatever I know to whoever is interested, any time. I apparently am fond of Punjabi music(can't read/write or speak properly though) and play guitar occasional. Cooking Indian food is yet another talent I inherited and can cook up some cool stuff considered tough in Indian Cooking.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n","Location":"India"}
