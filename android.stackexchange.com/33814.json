I started with a Acorn Electron, but found my way through different home computers until I started developing software in about 1990. I started programming in C++ but has since then programmed in, Cobol, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript and Ruby. In my paid job I today develop in C# on the .Net platform. Over the years I have also learned to like and love different platforms, depending on the situation I am in. So, I actually like both Windows, *nix and Mac platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Want to contact me?
