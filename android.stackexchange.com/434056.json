I am developing commercial applications since 2011, aiming for long term solutions with supreme quality.</p>\n\n<p>I've started by developing application for Microsoft platforms: from ASP.NET web application to Windows Phone and Windows 8 apps (published on Store). Meanwhile, still being in high school, I have developed several projects with Django/Python framework, including a stock exchange simulator. Then I shifted to something more hardcode, developing a C++ video conference software, with bandwidth variability compensation. </p>\n\n<p>In the last few month, I'm dedicated to an Android/iOS application, which allows to perform free calls even without data connection.</p>\n\n<p>Also, #SOreadytohelp.</p>\n","Location":"Trento, Italy"}
