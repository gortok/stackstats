That is neither in my job description nor in my career goals.  I enjoy working in the trenches of the software industry.  I build sturdy, robust, efficient and effective systems from horrible, incomplete or missing software design documents.  I'm good at 1.) determining what's required, 2.) producing a quality product and 3.) doing so in a timely manor.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a Microsoft guy: c# .net (winforms and webforms), vb6, c++.</p>\n\n<p>I work as an independent contractor.  I enjoy it.
