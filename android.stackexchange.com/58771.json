I am young web developer from Berlin, Germany.\nBeside backend programming I’m also interested in many aspects of application development like user interaction design. I usually tend to think a lot about those things even if I am not in a position where this is a requirement. I like to solve problems with their simplest possible solution.</p>\n","Location":"Berlin, Germany"}
