I now run an Internet service provider called Snowball Effect that I started with my brother Storm in 1998. Snowball specialises in wireless, hosting,  and ADSL. Storm heads our web development team. Our offices are based in Technopark, Stellenbosch (close to Cape Town) South Africa where we also have a fully redundant data centre that we built from scratch.</p>\n\n<p>My speciality apart from computer networking is business management especially operations. I have a intense undying passion for programming that started when I first laid my hands on a ZX-81. I am well versed in PHP and MySQL and I am enjoying learning Android. I am currently working on an app that I hope to launch by end 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Stellenbosch is beautiful wine country in South Africa. Here are my favourite wine estates as of 8 Jan 2012:\nGlen Elly, Delheim, Muraie, Dornier, Ken Forrester, Meerlust, Thelema, Camberley, Jordan Wines, Thelema.</p>\n\n<p>I see myself as ADD and BC. Before, I was ADD and now I am BC. My world changed when I discovered Basecamp.</p>\n","Location":"Stellenbosch, South Africa"}
