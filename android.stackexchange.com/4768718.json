Linux is my preferred environment, although Mac and Windows are nice too. I mainly use Arch Linux, but Ubuntu is fun too. I have a special place for <code>Go</code>. Imo, it's a genius combination of the best features of dynamic and static languages so that it runs fast but writes simple.</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
