This is all just pure a hobby.  </p>\n\n<p>BTW, I'm also a bit of an amateur at creating interesting CGI artwork, which basically means that I'm still keeping my art very simple. Less objects in the image generally means the rendering will be simpler and faster so as a result, some of my art is NSFW. Most is more like my gravatar. And some is pretty decent. :-) </p>\n","Location":"Netherlands"}
