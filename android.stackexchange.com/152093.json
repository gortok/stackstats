But then, quite suddenly I became allergic to C++, to its instability, useless bloat, crude syntax and its tendency to send apples three times around the earth just to be delivered to your neighbor.</p>\n\n<p>I now completely switched to C, C11 if possible, and occasionally some perl, sed or sh when I just need to do some scripting. I am much involved with the standardization of C and writing up a book <a href=\"http://icube-icps.unistra.fr/index.php/File:ModernC.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Modern C</a>. Feedback for these activities is highly welcome.</p>\n\n<p>I am the author of <a href=\"http://p99.gforge.inria.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">P99</a> a set of preprocessor macros for C99. People will say that P99 is a useless bloat, has crude syntax and has tendency to send apples once around the earth just to be delivered to your neighbor. But if it is already two orbits that we gain, it is worth it, isn't it?</p>\n\n<p>As an additional feature, on some platforms P99 now also emulates a lot of C11, atomics, threads, type generics, be surprised!</p>\n","Location":"Strasbourg, France"}
