Located in Belgium, I am studying Computer Science at the <a href=\"http://www.ua.ac.be/main.aspx?c=.ENGLISH\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Antwerp</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When I think a post can be improved I will try to do so by fixing grammatical or spelling errors, clarifying meaning without changing it, correcting minor mistakes, adding related resources or links. For the less obvious things of those I will leave a note in the edit, click on the date to see this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I will only edit content in posts once</strong>, and let the author or other users be free to choose to rollback; when there are opposing views, we can raise this to meta to let the majority decide which revision of the post they want.</p>\n\n<p>This will be done with respect of the original author and when I'm sure enough that it would only improve the post, <strong>if you need to contact me</strong> then you can e-mail me at the following address:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ip9UF.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Or if you have enough reputation, try to send me a message with <code>@TomWij</code> on the <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/118/root-access\">Super User Chat</a> where I am usually when I am online.</p>\n\n<p>Have a nice day! :)</p>\n","Location":"Belgium"}
