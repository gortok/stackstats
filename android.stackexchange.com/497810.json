Sigh.</p>\n\n<p>Since making the move from hacking to hawking, I climbed the corporate greasy pole, raised sums from loose change to a billion dollars (boy, was that a bubble!) and co-founded product, service and professional service businesses. In Cambridge I set up Beginspace, the world's first popup startup centre, and Ideaspace, the incubation co-working space operated by the University of Cambridge. </p>\n\n<p>My day job is as an ordained minister in the Church of England, which is why I sometimes call myself an <em>ordained entrepreneur</em>. I thought I'd coined that term, but someone beat me to it. Drat. I'm also cofounder of Rumbly, \"The Amazon of sandwiches,\" shaking up workplace lunches in the UK.</p>\n","Location":"Cambridge, United Kingdom"}
