I also have a pretty good exposure to XPages.

I would not consider myself a newbie in SharePoint but there’s a long road ahead before I become an expert :)</p>\n\n<p>Apart from SharePoint and Notes, the latest developments in HTML5 and CSS3 interest me and I try to incorporate it in my projects.</p>\n\n<p>You can connect with me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maurya_n\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/naveenmaurya\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n","Location":"India"}
