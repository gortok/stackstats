I'm interested in Galois representations coming from abelian varieties (especially elliptic curves) and how they relate to the arithmetic of L-functions and modular forms. I'm also interested in algebraic geometry <em>a la</em> Grothendieck, and more generally, everything categorical. I like to think that I'm more interested in logic and foundations than the average mathematician.</p>\n","Location":"Ithaca, NY"}
