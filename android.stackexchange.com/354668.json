Rails is nice but Ruby is not my thing, and if I have to use PHP, then I choose Laravel.</p>\n\n<p>I am a pragmatic perfectionist, always striving to do the best thing while trying to maintain a healthy balance between perfect and practical. Well built software, with organized, clean and tested code, making use of best practices and proven methodologies is a beautiful thing.</p>\n\n<p>Being also an environmentalist at heart, I always strive to do what's best for the environment and I constantly try to spread awareness of \"little big\" things that anyone can do and can make a huge difference for everyone on the planet.</p>\n\n<p>I have also always been connected to sports since I was young. Besides bodyboard, surf and MTB, which I do regularly, I practised swimming for 9 years, rowing for 4 years (including a national championship and lots of smaller regional races), and Kung Fu and Tai Chi since 1998.</p>\n\n<p>I am cheerful, sociable, easy going and a person of principles, greatly appreciating values such as honesty, humility, righteousness, patience and loyalty.</p>\n","Location":"Portugal"}
