By night, I play with Perl/Python and C. I tend to avoid non-browser environments on Windows, but I'll do GUI or terminal programming on OS X and Linux. I'm not too shy around AVR microcontrollers either--though that's a bit of a hobby.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI hacked together an OpenID provider just to log in to Stack Overflow.\r\n</p>","Location":"Minnesota"}
