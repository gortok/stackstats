Highlights include Lockheed Martin F-35 Lighting II, Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Airbus A380, and China Comet Rail II (high speed train) programs. I also have experience in pneumatics designing valves for all sectors of industry. Prior to engineering I was a 9-year Environmental Chemist and Consultant to private sector and government programs.</p>\n\n<p>I am also an active participant in the Libertarian movement and a humanitarian. I have the following message to the world:</p>\n\n<p>If you are not questioning your world, your world becomes questionable. The road you take is not up to you. It is up to our well-intentioned yet misguided, wool-coated, fellow neighbors who outnumber us thousands to one. This is why we have a lot of work ahead of us in convincing the herd on how to liberate ourselves from the shepherds who intend on corralling you, me, our children, and everyone else to containment, slaughter, and pasture.</p>\n\n<p>This is a fact of life for all who have fallen asleep while carelessly grazing in the greenest of pastures brought to you by American corporatism, the Federal Reserve, and Kool Aid. This is a most pernicious poison of the sweetest taste and one that we must recognize as having the ability of ending our existence.</p>\n\n<p>Be wise and live long and prosper. But never do this at the expense of your free will nor of the life, liberty, or happiness of your brothers and sisters that are separated from us by oceans. Because if we do, it sets the precedence that it is also permissible to do this to us.</p>\n","Location":"Los Angeles, CA"}
