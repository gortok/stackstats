Everything else in my computer life --from entertainment to productivity-- got itself a one-way ticket to Linux, along with my passion.</p>\n\n<p>Switching to and learning Linux has broadened my horizons and made me become ever more knowledgeable and capable than before. I'm always looking for new stuff to learn and ways to improve my skills.</p>\n\n<p>I program predominantly in Python, followed by Scheme, JavaScript and C#, though syntactically and conceptually I've learned more than a dozen more.</p>\n","Location":"~/"}
