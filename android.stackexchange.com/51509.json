I loved building things as a welder, but could not see myself doing this until I reached age 65.</p>\n\n<p>After my Honorable Discharge in the early 1990s, I used my G.I. Bill to go to school and received my Bachelor of Science Degree in Physics four years later.</p>\n\n<p>Using a love of computers since I played on a Commodore 64 at 10 years old and two (2) C++ electives that I had taken in school, I began working in the computer programming field.</p>\n\n<p>The recession following ENRON in 2001 left me working at a remedial job for a little over two years while I brushed up on my skills at a local community college in SQL and first learned what the new .NET Framework was all about.</p>\n\n<p>I have had the pleasure of working as a Software Developer since 2003.</p>\n\n<p>For a short while, I pulled in a little extra income by running a moonlighting business under the name <a href=\"http://www.joeswelding.biz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joe's Welding</a>. Dangerous working conditions and non-paying customers prompted me to sell my mobile welding equipment about the time my son was born.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I am exclusively a Software Developer. My language of choice is C#, and I enjoy working with databases.</p>\n\n<p>If you care to find me anywhere else, just do a search on my screen name: <code>jp2code</code></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.jp2code.net/images/aboveAvgJoe.jpg\" alt=\"Above Average Joe\"></p>\n","Location":"Longview, TX"}
