And, usually as hobby, I also like to build systems which generate data.</p>\n\n<p>HTML, Javascript, Websockets, Python, MongoDB, RabbitMQ; that kind of stack. I love AngularJS.</p>\n\n<p>I also know (or probably knew) quite a bit about audio programming (down to the last bit, as in multichannel surround sound wav files, surround sound mixing, audio resampling and filtering, in C++, <a href=\"http://www.mayasound.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mayasound.com</a>) as well as 3D-graphics-stuff. I wanted to create a full-blown audio sequencer in 3D space (and still would like to, but I've realized that I can't do this without a proper team, which is hard to find). Nowadays that would be awesome considering that stuff like Oculus Rift exists.</p>\n\n<p>I've played a lot with home automation (12V LED strips, RPi &amp; Co., down to the power transistor level and Arduino PWM modulation, even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWF8_Mfo1ek\" rel=\"nofollow\">ATtiny45 programming</a>, and sensors like temperature, humidity and pressure)</p>\n\n<p>I'm a PC (as in \"convinced Windows user\"), but I love Debian and Ubuntu.</p>\n\n<p>I'm an Android user and have done my share of programming on that platform as well; that's what I'm into at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>I've also got above average networking experience (routing, subnets, UTM, DNS, SNMP) for someone who isn't in the networking business.</p>\n","Location":""}
