I have experience with Python, HTML+CSS, Javascript, and Batch. I know more about Python and HTML+CSS than Javascript, but I know pretty much everything about Batch. I want to try and learn C/C++/C# once I figure out the difference between the three. Currently designing a website, so that will come soon.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/4252365/james-lynch\"><img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/4252365.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for James Lynch on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for James Lynch on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" /></a></p>\n","Location":""}
