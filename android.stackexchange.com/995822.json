By trade, I'm a software engineer, specializing in web applications of late, and learning about Android and iOS app development in the almost non-existent time between projects. I have training in human-computer interaction and human factors, and have an excellent eye when it comes to end-user experience. </p>\n\n<p>In my spare time, I like to hang out with my 2-year-old daughter, brew beer, study philosophy, cook, and read about the Hapsburg dynasty. When it comes to food and drink, I'm just as fascinated by the chemistry as I am with the taste. I'm a man of faith, science, and very bad humor. My favorite place in the world is probably the Umbrian countryside in Italy -- between the food, wine, and beautiful towns with architecture that dates back to the middle ages and are still alive and bustling, the place brings me joy. </p>\n","Location":"New Jersey, USA"}
