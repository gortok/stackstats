Currently, I am a third year PhD student at Wroclaw University of Technology with a focus on optimization of algorithms used in networks and computer programs (remote program). During my PhD studies I presented papers at international IEEE conferences on the subject of optimization of Elastic Optical and Software Defined Networks. Moreover, in March of 2015 I was invited to Simon Fraser University to present a speech on my current research topics. I have 5 years of experience in the industry. I started as an apprentice in a very large polish company Nasza Klasa and after two months of practice I was invited to a 4-month contract for the position of a project manager. Then, I worked for a year as an IT Administrator at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology. For more than two years I have been involved in professional Java software development.
