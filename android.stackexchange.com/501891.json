Survived CASE and 4GL tools and the dotcom boom where I picked up ASP and PHP along with SQL Server and MySQL and HTML, Javascript and CSS. An interest in video led me to Silverlight and IIS Media Server and a job at Microsoft. Currently working on the Kindle Fire platform where I care about video experiences, both native and via web(view). For fun I've been kicking the tires on AppEngine.</p>\n\n<p>Always learning, always happy to help</p>\n","Location":""}
