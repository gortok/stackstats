The CIT program is part of the Computer Science department within the College of Science and Engineering. So while code wasn't the total focus, we did take a large number of coding classes. My Sophomore and Junior years I interned at <a href=\"http://www.terma.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terma North America</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After graduation, I became a full time Business Systems Analyst at Terma North America. My job was to support our ERP system and other business systems used by the company. I ended up writing a great deal of code to make these systems support the business needs when commercially available software couldn't do what we wanted for the price we wanted to pay. I built quite a few web and service applications to support these objectives, all done by myself as the sole developer.</p>\n\n<p>I currently work at <a href=\"http://www.ogsys.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OGsys</a> as a Software Developer utilizing ASP.NET development skills, working with a team to build software needed by oil and gas companies.</p>\n\n<p>In college, I had taken a web developer class. It was really a survey of HTTP, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Java Servlets, JSP, and ASP.NET Web Forms. Naturally we covered so many topics that I didn't gain expertise in any particular one. In my job at TNA, I made heavy use of Web Forms. I started interacting with Stack Overflow because I noticed that a lot of the issues I had with Web Forms were already answered there. So I began interacting more, and learned about ASP.NET MVC, which really opened my eyes to the wider world of web development, and I began devouring information about the various technologies used in web development and ASP.NET.</p>\n","Location":"Fort Worth, Texas"}
