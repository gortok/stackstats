I love to answer questions that relate to Linux and try to do so when I have spare moments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I'm a Linux guy that has to manage customers' Windows servers and workstations as part of my living.</strong>  It pays well but I find it frustrating to have to deal with Windows-specific issues and interfaces when I could just be done already if I used my favorite tools.  Sometimes I write programs in Go that help me manage the Windows machines and sometimes I just give up and ask for help here.  I don't love Windows and I'm highly appreciative of the folks here that have clever answers for frustrating problems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I'm a Go programmer that used to be a Perl programmer... and I love that it's part of my day job.</strong>  I loved Perl very much, but there is just too much goodness in Go to stay on the Perl wagon.  I love having a cross-platform language that packs its own runtime without needing to hack something together like I had to do with Perl.  I haven't really answered much in the way of Go questions, but I'm certainly on the lookout for questions that aren't already answered well.  I spend as much time as I can expanding my Go experience, especially when it comes to building cross-platform tools to help myself or my customers live a happier computer-using life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I'm a father and a business owner.</strong>  I love my kid more than anything else.  Seriously, who doesn't say that?  I already know I'm biased, but he's the best kid anyone could ask for.  I run my own business and have done so though multiple relationships, several staffing changes, many city moves, a bunch of chemotherapy, and plenty of general business and life chaos.  Through my business, I have provided valuable input to giant companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson and Amazon.com all the way down to mom-and-pop-sized local businesses and many in between.  Running my business has been an amazing amount of freedom and an incredible amount of burden.  And it has been an incredible experience.</p>\n","Location":""}
