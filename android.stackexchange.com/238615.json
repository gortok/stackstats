Big thanks to the the Stackoverflow community for all of your guidance and encouragement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mandarin Chinese:</strong> (Moderatorâ™¦ on <a href=\"http://chinese.stackexchange.com/users/2274/growler\">Chinese SE</a>) </p>\n\n<p>I've also been learning Mandarin Chinese for 6 years and have spent some time over in Taiwan (5 months) and Beijing (2 weeks). I was given the opportunity to provide interpretation for General Electric at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. To give back to StackExchange, I've recently become active in helping out on the Chinese Language and Usage site (<a href=\"http://chinese.stackexchange.com/\">http://chinese.stackexchange.com/</a>). </p>\n","Location":"Connecticut"}
