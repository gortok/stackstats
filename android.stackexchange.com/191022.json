I am mostly interested in low level languages, around the areas of C/C++, but I enjoy tinkering in anything, so I have messed with HTML and C#.  I also have experience writing Android applications with Java.  My interests include AI and parallelism.  I just like to know how things work down to the nitty gritty.</p>\n","Location":"Kansas"}
