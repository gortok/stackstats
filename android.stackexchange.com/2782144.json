As a kid I started out with a dialect of LOGO, quickly graduating to a variant of Pascal, both of which I mainly used to make games. Later I taught myself HTML, thinking I was now a certified web developer, as way too many people did at the time (it was about the year 2000). Once I grew up and went to college I learned to properly use languages and environments like Turbo Pascal, Delphi, ASP, PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS, C and C++ and I even taught some Java, even though I never learned it before I did. I guess my college had a rather desperate lack of teachers.</p>\n\n<p>School never was my thing, however. My grades were good, but I could never bring myself to completing the menial task of proving that after I had already derived Circle and Square classes off of a Shape class I could really do it again for a Triangle. I ended up with a job where I wrote embedded software for hardware that the company I worked for developed in-house. While a good learning experience, it turned out that this was not my thing and after about a year I was looking for another job. I rolled into the web development business. After 2 relatively short employments I ended up with my current employer where at the time of writing I've happily worked for almost five years and will hopefully continue to work for many more.</p>\n\n<p>I've been responsible for a lot of websites, mainly built on LAMP environments. I also maintain the Android app connected to one of those projects and am slowly rolling into iOS development.</p>\n\n<p>In the mean time, I've been teaching myself C# and XNA4 (even though it's end of life) so I can start creating games again in my spare time. I've also taken on a <a href=\"https://github.com/NMe84/Sick-Beard-TPB-A\" rel=\"nofollow\">Python project</a> because I was tired of using defective software.</p>\n","Location":"Eindhoven, Netherlands"}
