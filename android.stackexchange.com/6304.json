I know how to write SQL and PL/SQL code for maximum performance. And I love writing complex queries normally required for business intelligence, data analysis and data transformation. </p>\n\n<p>My colleagues regard me as a master in black magic art of SQL performance tuning. For example, I once was asked to look at a data transformation procedure which was running for over 5 hours, which was unacceptable due to limited run window. By changing just 1 line of an SQL query I was able to bring down the run time to 15 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>I openly share my expertise with whoever asks for my help which makes me a go-to person when it comes to Oracle performance tuning. I also share my knowledge on my blog (<a href=\"http://www.ozmoroz.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ozmoroz.com/</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Most of my work experience was in financial industry: big banks, stock brokers, superannuation industry. I have an in-depth understanding of ASX share trading systems.</p>\n\n<p>I am located in Melbourne, Australia.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to contact me regarding a possible job opportunity, please do that via <a href=\"http://au.linkedin.com/in/sergeystadnik/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"LinkedIn\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://au.linkedin.com/in/sergeystadnik\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.linkedin.com/img/webpromo/btn_viewmy_160x33.png\" alt=\"My LinkedIn profile\"></a></p>\n","Location":"Australia"}
