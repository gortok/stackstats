I don't have any favorite programming language, whatever can get the job done is what I go with. To elaborate on that in my current position I have my hand in several C# (.NET) projects while also being the main resource for Android development. On my own personal projects I still end up using PHP and MySQL as my back-end with Angular being my new obsession for front-end development. While I don't consider myself an expert in any particular area I would say I'm most confident working with Android and databases (preferably MySQL, but any kind of SQL will do).</p>\n\n<p>In my free time when I'm not building my own applications I'm either reading a book or getting lost in the city or in a park. I consider myself a workaholic though.</p>\n","Location":"Milwaukee, WI"}
