Driven by an insatiable appetite for learning new ways to do things better. With better being defined as more usable to the end user, for which goal IT ought to exist, within bounds of reason.</p>\n\n<p>I'm primarily skilled in Wintel systems and end user support, with hobbies in *nix and growing experience in MS server management, Office 2010 deployment and support, Windows 7 use, and several different types of professional business environments ranging from fast-food mega-conglomo-corps to international law firms to one of the largest corporate banks in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Currently I am Network Administrator for a custom manufacturing firm primarily involved in the energy industry.</p>\n","Location":"Oklahoma"}
