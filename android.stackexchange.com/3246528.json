However...</p>\n\n<p>For a decade I've been \"into\" VBasic 6.0 and VBA, thus acquiring some sort of barebones intro in the vicinity of object-oriented \"stuff\" and now ... </p>\n\n<p>... definitely last (after a brief fling at Javascript) but certainly not least: <strong>Java</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>But gee whiz what a trip it's been so far for the 5 or so months I've been seriously trying. Messing with Z80 assembly language had a more palatable learning curve.</p>\n\n<p>I deliberately sought and bought an Oreilly book by Pat Niemeyer and, after mostly-profitlessly struggling thru the previews and don't-do's and rambling verbosity and cuteness ... well, the title is \"Learning Java\", but it should be more like \"Learn the History and Details of Java Once You Know Java.\" I hate it as an initial text.</p>\n\n<p>I also own Sams' (Cadenhead) Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days (pretty good; it is what it says--i.e., sort of lightweight) and am considering Ivor Horton's Beginning Java, which is very detailed in terms of threads and GUIs and other stuff. The \"For Dummies\" book I initially bought stood up well for a couple of weeks (it is what it says, too). </p>\n\n<p>In short, though, I'm getting the hang of it: threads, events, GUIs, directory tree walking, generics... </p>\n\n<p>And GridBagLayout has freed me from Netbeans GUIbuilder. I heartily recommend investigating it.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. My graphic is a zoomed-in region of a sort-of-northwest part of the Mandelbrot set. Wrote code to make it many years ago; found Java code to create the initial picture; modified it to allow zoom-in. Math's purty, ain't it?</p>\n","Location":"Greenhills, OH USA"}
