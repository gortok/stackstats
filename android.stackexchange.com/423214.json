I think ideas should be free. Code is just an idea. So I support open source and I am slowly working on open sourcing all of my projects, even the profitable ones. They're currently on <a href=\"https://github.com/JakarCo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/JakarCo</a> .</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>As a Developer</h2>\n\n<p>I am a software designer. I like planning application architecture and database structure. I like thinking about how these things are going to work.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>I hate writing code</strong> because... its easy. The planning is challenging and fun. For the most part, outputting code is as easy as speaking - though way more time consuming and way more boring.</p>\n\n<p>My most fruitful time as a developer is spent in thought. But I may be unique in my ability to visualize and plan extensive amounts of code without writing it.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>As a Person</h2>\n\n<p>I try to empower myself with knowledge. I love to learn new things and I love to understand <strong>why</strong> something is the way it is. I like to learn about most anything.  </p>\n\n<p>I share my knowledge with others on Facebook (and soon on my forum once it sucks less) so they can be better informed and live better lives.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that... I don't feel like blabbing any more right now. I might add more later.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Hobbies</h2>\n\n<p>Being happy and healthy. I eat well, do yoga, play video games, read (a little), watch TED talks, hang out with friends/family (but not enough). And I like to keep stuff clean.</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
