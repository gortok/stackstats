And watch a lot of the movies. And a lot of TV shows.</p>\n\n<p>OK, I'm a geek. But I'm not a \"Fan\".</p>\n\n<p>I tend to prefer \"soft\" science fiction over \"hard\". I also have a fondness for author's first novels and one-hit-wonders; something about the freshness and enthusiasm they bring to the genre.</p>\n","Location":""}
