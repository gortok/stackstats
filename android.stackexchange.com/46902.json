I have possibly had more experience with Java than with Python or C++, but I have found that tasks that are comparatively elegant in Python and other languages that share similar design concepts (first-class functions, etc.) often require an annoying amount of boilerplate in Java (thankfully, Java 8's lambdas and method references seem like they'll alleviate a decent amount of my annoyances in that regard); I also wish Java had either reified generics or at least a bit more support for static/compile-time code generation like with C++'s templates (at the very least, method overriding based on runtime type would allow a whole lot of Java code that interfaces with non-generic/primitives-only APIs to be less verbose). I'm also trying out Scala and LISP, though I haven't made much progress on that recently.</p>\n","Location":""}
