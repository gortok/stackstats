The irony: I don't even give a s**t about the reputation points I have earned so far at S.O., let alone being accused of colluding with others to gain a [pathetic] 370 reputation points (sic!). Special thanks to <code>BalusC</code>, <code>McDowell</code>, <code>Matt Handy</code> and a handful of others who have helped me here. <strong>Sayonara my friends</strong>, I will miss you.</p>\n\n<p>As of <strong>December 18th 2014</strong> Australian EST, I have stopped flagging posts here at S.O. as I can see that the whole moderator process is totally broken. This <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27526219/uninstall-chainfire-3d-on-android\">post</a>, like others taken from my flagging history, shows that while my comment for the post was <em>\"This post should be moved to android.stackexchange.com.\"</em> was marked as <em>\"declined - a moderator reviewed your flag, but found no evidence to support it\"</em>, and yet this <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/1288/bill-the-lizard\">poster</a> commented the same thing as I said, as in: <em>\"You might find some help on Android Enthusiasts\"</em>. Go figure! If you read the post properly, it would be best moved to <em>android.stackexchange.com</em> so other people can help the OP since it's not a programming question per se, but it's Android related.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, it's time I let other S.O. participants get annoyed by this moderator process. I have had enough!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Java programmer starting out on Assembly, Pascal, C, Cobol and dBase; now ending up with Java and Android. Did a 360-degree turn from proprietary software to OpenSource - and loving it - although kept one Windoze machine to support legacy apps of clients. As soon as clients' apps have been migrated / substituted with OpenSource alternatives, Windoze machine will go to the guillotine (figuratively, of course).</p>\n\n<p>The main reason I moved to S.O. is because Sun's (now Oracle's) forums are plagued with too many nitwits and prigs (American English: self-centered pricks). Should S.O. forums one day suffer the same decadence, I guess I shall have to move again!</p>\n","Location":"Australia"}
