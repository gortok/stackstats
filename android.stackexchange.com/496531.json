I like FreeBSD, Linux Mint, Anime, Lua, Ruby, and Go. I'm in a love/hate (but mostly love) relationship with Docker. I like configuring systems and doing so in a way that makes them modular and scalable. I build PCs, and like building small, lean and minimalistic machines rather than giant overpowered behemoths (though I will do the latter in situations that require it).</p>\n","Location":""}
