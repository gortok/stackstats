Currently I am VP Engineering at <a href=\"http://Mailcloud.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://Mailcloud.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Mailcloud is a secure, cloud based email and file organisation service launching in 2014.</p>\n\n<p>My technical background comprises end-to-end software engineering including SQL and NoSQL databases, desktop applications, mobile applications, web applications, cloud infrastructure, process automation and continuous deployments.</p>\n\n<p>I specialise in C#, JavaScript, C++, T-SQL, PL/SQL and I’ve also been using Ruby, C, F#, SQF, Python, VB and Delphi. I like to call myself a language-agnostic programmer.</p>\n\n<p>The above programming languages can be utilised in many technical stacks. I’ve been applying them with Microsoft On-Premise Stack (Windows Server, ASP.NET, Microsoft SQL, WPF), Microsoft Azure Stack (Cloud Services, SQL, Service Bus, Storage, AppFabric), MEAN Stack on Linux (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) and Nokia Qt Stack (Linux/Windows, Qt).</p>\n\n<p>During the many years of my technological voyage I have picked up many useful tools, the most important to me are Visual Studio, TeamCity, WebStorm, New Relic, AppDynamics, NH Profiler and Puppet.</p>\n\n<p>Before coming to the UK I worked in different software companies that specialised in stock markets, financial services, marketing and automotive industrial processes. When I got to the UK I specifically targeted Web-based companies, so I could get as much hands-on experience with large scale web applications as possible.</p>\n\n<p>I have experienced different levels of system complexity (from internal stock broking apps to customer facing e-commerce systems), software architecture (designed many distributed systems), refactoring (made legacy code to be understandable, robust and maintainable), leadership (software engineering and testing teams).</p>\n\n<p>In my personal life I am a licensed skipper, all-life snowboarder, technology enthusiast and gym freak.</p>\n","Location":"London, United Kingdom"}
