Prefer Linux over Windows and prefer my own OS over Linux.  I enjoy being challenged, especially when it comes to interacting with hardware.  I find only a few things more satisfying than getting that one bit correct which makes the entire thing run because the hardware says that bit has to be that way.  Don't get me wrong its maddening up to the point when you fix it, and you start to try to convince yourself that the hardware is broken, and a few rare times it is, but getting it to finally work is extremely satisfying.</p>\n","Location":"Boston, MA"}
