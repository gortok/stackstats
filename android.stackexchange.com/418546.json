Mine was Kuzon, he is a character for the tv seires 'Avatar, The Last Airbender'.</p>\n\n<p>Kuzon was the second son of Fire Lord Izuma and Jiroh and the younger brother of Fire Lord Sozin. In his youth, he was also a good friend of Avatar Aang. Although he was appointed Commander of the first Fire Nation Armored Division by Sozin at age 18, and commanded these tanks during Sozin's assault on the Southern Air Temple, Kuzon could not tolerate his brother's plan to completely destroy the Air Nomad race. When he discovered what Sozin planned to do, Kuzon freed several Air Nomads from their cells in the camp. He was promptly discovered by Sozin, and barely escaped the battle with his life. Branded a traitor by his home country, Kuzon had nowhere to go but the community of refugee airbenders. He joined a group of airbenders who chose to covertly fight the Fire Nation and assist the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribe forces. Though he was once captured and brought back to the Fire Nation to face execution, he escaped with the help of his airbender compatriotsTaro and Kunchen, and spent the rest of his life helping to stem the tide of Fire Nation onslaught.</p>\n","Location":"Sky Land"}
