In high school, I wrote Mandelbrot set programs on a $10 Commodore 64 from a yard sale, an HP 48 calculator, and a Java 1.0 applet. I've entered 68k machine code by hand into RAM on on a computer I built on a breadboard, and I've implemented an object oriented layer in Scheme for scripting interactive educational multimedia.\n<p>\nSee <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/brian-campbell\">my resume on Stack Overflow careers</a> for information on my professional background.\n<p>\nAll code samples I post on Stack Overflow (other than those excerpted from other projects for explanatory purposes, which should be credited as so) are licensed under the <a href=\"http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WTFPLv2</a>, or the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license that all contributions on Stack Overflow are required to be licensed under, at your choice.</p>\n","Location":"Massachusetts"}
