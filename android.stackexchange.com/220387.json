I'm a \"kitchen sink\" programmer at the moment, working on just about everything at one point or another.  No, I can't answer any questions you might have.  Certainly not before SOELive 2013, and quite possibly not afterwards.  </p>\n\n<p>Prior to working at SOE, I was a programmer working in Java/C++.  </p>\n\n<p>I used to be a PDF specialist (for far too many years), but had been broadening my horizons.  None the less, I'm a committer on iText, though possibly the least active one for quite some time.  I also worked with Eclipse for a couple years, and have some small experience developing plugins for it.</p>\n","Location":"Carlsbad, CA"}
