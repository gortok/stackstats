This taught me how to follow and read code to determine the intent of the original programmer.  I also learned to be persistent and optimistic about problem solving.</p>\n\n<p>The back end of this accounting package was rewritten to a SQL Server back end by the senior dev on our team and the reporting was moved to Crystal Reports which was mostly done by myself.  Recently I wrote a Crystal Reports Addin for MS-Access so that we can continue to use the latest Crystal Reports.  </p>\n\n<p>I have also done development work on other smaller projects by adding value as requested by the customer.  I am not afraid to work with code that has been written by other programmers.  </p>\n\n<p>Stack Overflow has been a good environment for me to sharpen my skills as a programmer and learn about best practices.  I enjoy finding a simple and practical solution for complex problems.</p>\n","Location":"Bradford, PA, United States"}
