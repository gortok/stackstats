I started playing with simple HTML &amp; CSS when I was 11. When I was 12 I moved on to PHP &amp; MySQL (Tad bit of JS). Once I got familiar with Object Oriented Programming through PHP, I got into the world of desktop programming with C#.NET at 13. Once I realized at age 15 just how much I hated the .NET framework (distribution, performance) then I started learning C++! From simple command prompts to WinAPI. I worked my way up until now, but I still have lots more to learn, that is why I'm here at SO!</p>\n","Location":"Bridgeport, TX"}
