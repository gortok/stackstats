My background is in video game development and I am now involved in serious games and simulations: making game technology work for business. I'm also working on products in the cloud and mobile spaces.</p>\n\n<p>I have managed several teams of developers over many years building cutting-edge products in fast-moving and high-pressure environments. I know how to focus and prioritize so that the important things get done.</p>\n\n<p>I am a passionate technologist and agile practitioner. Agile techniques have bought much professional and personal benefit. I have had great success with TDD and am convinced of its ability to produce better code that stabilizes more quickly whilst being evolved rapidly. I'm also a fan of functional programming and the potential it offers for safety, predictability and concurrency. I have integrated modern functional techniques into my development life without sacrificing on practicality.</p>\n\n<p>I regularly contribute to the open source community and I am a founder of and organise two monthly games industry meetups in Brisbane.</p>\n\n<p>My linkedin page:\n<a href=\"https://au.linkedin.com/in/ashleydavis75\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://au.linkedin.com/in/ashleydavis75</a></p>\n\n<p>The meetup groups\n<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Game-Technology-Brisbane/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.meetup.com/Game-Technology-Brisbane/</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Game-development-Brisbane/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.meetup.com/Game-development-Brisbane/</a></p>\n\n<p>My open source repositories: \n<a href=\"https://github.com/codecapers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/codecapers</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Real-Serious-Games\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Real-Serious-Games</a></p>\n\n<p>My web page: \n<a href=\"http://www.codecapers.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codecapers.com.au/</a></p>\n\n<p>Skills: Management of development teams and projects\nMentoring and coaching developers\nMaking sense of technology for senior management\nDeveloping strategies for longer-term technical projects\nLanguages: C++, C#, Python, Javascript, Lua, Assembly Language\nUI development\nClient-side web development\nServer and cloud development skills\nCompiler, interpreter, debugger and API development\nData export, conversion &amp; processing tools\nPerformance analysis and optimization\nAutomated defect and performance testing\nComputer games, engine &amp; tools development\nComputer graphics, special effects and renderers</p>\n","Location":"Brisbane"}
