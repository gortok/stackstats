It's been a while I am self learning all the techniques and methods to become a successful programmer. </p>\n\n<p>Instead coding, I also like to do Maths. I love to play with numbers and solving Calculus problems. As per me, this is what every coder must learn before programming. </p>\n\n<p>At end, Cheers !</p>\n","Location":""}
