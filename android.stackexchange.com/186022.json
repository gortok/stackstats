Often, the problem is in a mistaken expectation of what should happen, or a mistaken interpretation of what did happen.</p>\n\n<p>In order to help them, one has to make assumptions and guess at these things, and the guesses may be off-target, resulting in an annoying waste of time for both sides.</p>\n\n<p>It's like Nebuchadnezzar asking for an interpretation of his dream but <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%202%3A1-11&amp;version=ESV\" rel=\"nofollow\">refusing to reveal the dream itself</a>. I'm looking for effective ways to remind people. There are wonderful articles on how to write a good question, but a huge class of people will not find and read such an article.
