However, I only know Scratch right now, but hopefully, after going to a program this summer (at brown), I will learn how to program. I am interested in Creative Commons, play drums, read the newspaper, and a ton more. I also participate in Kids Walk for Kids with Cancer, a walk in New York and New Jersey. You can check it out here: <a href=\"http://kidswalkforkidswithcancer.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://kidswalkforkidswithcancer.org/</a> </p>\n\n<p>I also have a youtube channel, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/undacovabroda45\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/user/undacovabroda45</a>. For now, I am just uploading cc-licensed short videos. Just give me credit if u use them.</p>\n","Location":"San Francisco, CA"}
