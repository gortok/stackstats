I also adore a couple of specific Alaskan girls.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the geek world, I'm a cross-platform sysadmin from an ISP background -- mostly FreeBSD. I know Perl, bash and some PHP.  I'm interested in learning more PHP, Javascript, Android, Hadoop, and Puppet.  I've recently jumped into InfoSec in the financial sector.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe quality of my personal web site (circa 1995) should be attributed to how much spare time I have, not to my skill. :-)\n</p>\n","Location":"Anchorage, AK"}
