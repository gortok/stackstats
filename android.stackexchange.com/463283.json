I am truly passionate when it comes to developing software with performance aspects, the ones that horizontal scaling is a must and you need to think of distributed processing from the start. Using different technologies is like putting puzzle pieces together to me to form the picture as a whole. And the picture is eye pleasing only when the pieces are a fit.</p>\n","Location":"Toronto, Canada"}
