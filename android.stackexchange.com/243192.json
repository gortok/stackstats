Recently, I've spent my weekdays doing Android development.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, a big programming interest of mine has been rule engines.  I've worked quite a bit with both JBoss Drools and Sandia National Labs' Jess.  Drools is my favorite by far.</p>\n\n<p>And in my spare time, I've been working on a side-project using Apache Wicket (my favorite for web development), Spring, JPA/Hibernate, JMS/ActiveMQ, Joda Time, SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets), Quartz and so on... basically, all of the cool and/or popular stuff.</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
