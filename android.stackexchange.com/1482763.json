I am currently a developer, interning at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory doing data quality work in their data warehouse using SQL, PL/SQL and Oracle Apex. I study M.I.S at San Jose State University, where I'll be graduating in May 2013, and I am also studying to get certified for Oracle's OCP curriculum (I am OCA as of January 2nd, 2013). My long term goal is to transition into a DBA role, but I am interested in big data/data analytics as well...</p>\n","Location":"San Jose, CA"}
