Afraid that I might get bored in class if they'd allow that, my father decided to teach me how to play chess and my mother showed me how to get our Commodore 64 to repeat my name over and over.</p>\n\n<pre><code>10 PRINT \"VIRTLINK\"\n20 GOTO 10\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I was much more interested in the Commodore than in chess and from Commodore Basic through QBasic, Visual Basic I worked my way up to C#. This was all self-taught until I decided to follow an education in Computer Science after getting my Building Sciences degree.</p>\n\n<p>I have a bachelor's degree in Building Sciences (BBE) and Computer Science (BSc), and I am currently working on getting my Computer Science master's degree.</p>\n","Location":""}
