I started my site intending to get to the bottom of <i>why we all can't just get along</i> as a bit of an SEO/keyword hack.  (It worked...try googling \"hostile fork\".)</p>\n\n<p>Until I figure out how to make everyone bring the best ideas to the table, I'm just blogging about software development.  Long term I hope that people searching for \"hostile fork x\" will find my site and consider engagement instead of forking.  Yet somehow it's easier to answer StackOverflow questions than make people get along.  Who knew?</p>\n\n<p>And yes I drew the fork.  I'm an artiste as well as a programmer. :P</p>\n","Location":"Ã†melia Island"}
