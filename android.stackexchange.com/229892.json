I often don't capitalize the first word in a sentence unless I'd capitalize it anywhere else. I use gender-neutral pronouns such as ey, em, and eir. end akezioneli ai iwz mai own fenedik spelin, bat djenereli nat hir et SO.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jcomeauictx\">facebook</a></p>","Location":"Petaluma, CA"}
