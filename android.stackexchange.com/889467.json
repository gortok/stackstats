These methods are applied as needed to accomplish specific tasks within apps that are mostly of a more conventional nature, with \"grey box\" human interaction and direction of the AI code emphasized over autonomous decision making on the part of that code.</p>\n\n<p>I also have extensive past experience with programming in primarily rule-based languages, including ART (Automated Reasoning Tool), and have fairly recent experience in maintaining a legacy Expert System that uses that approach, but now believe that development using conventional languages with specific embedded AI modules written in those same languages is, in most cases, a more useful approach.</p>\n","Location":"Los Angeles, CA"}
