Right now I'm playing with Java. I have written lots of PHP code in the past, made some excursions to C#. For quite some time I've been a Windows user, but recently I moved back to Linux for convenience.</p>\n\n<p>I've always been interested in software engineering and web technologies. My best addiction is a combination of mobile and cloud computing because I believe it's the future especially for where I am proud to come from. AFRICA!!!!</p>\n","Location":"Kampala"}
