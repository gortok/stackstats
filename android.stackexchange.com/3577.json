In 2011, I moved to Alaska and directed my interest towards Earth Science. My specialty is remote sensing of landscape processes in the circumpolar north, in particular wildfires. I like to use Python when I can, but will work in R, Matlab, NCL, IDL, or on occasion Fortran or C and have written a number of web-based and command-line applications that require tools such as Django, PHP, Perl, shell scripting and SQL, and of course HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I believe science needs to be reproducible and am enthusiastic about the technologies that enable this, in particular iPython notebooks and Sweave in R. Outside science, I am fond of linguistics, i18n, Unicode and all that.</p>\n","Location":"Alaska"}
