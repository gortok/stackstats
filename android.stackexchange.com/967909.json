My favorite OS is Debian, and now I am using Ubuntu coz it could save me a lot of energy to configure Chinese fonts, etc.\nMy Java working experience most focused on JSP, Tapestry, and some core Java thing. Also I have a couple of years experience on Oracle PL/SQL programming.\nPS: If you think my answers on stackoverflow.com helps you a lot, I'd appreciate that you can endorse my skills set <a href=\"http://cn.linkedin.com/pub/fred-wang/38/930/a46/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p>\n","Location":""}
