Even though my field is complex and nerdy by nature, I consider myself a down to earth guy. After working 10 years in Network Administration in both public and private sectors, my wife and I decided to chase our dreams go back to school.  I received a bachelor's of science from University of Arizona.  I feel that my experience and knowledge of computer systems coupled with my passion for software development gives me a holistic approach to the design and performance of the projects I work on.</p>\n","Location":"Portland, OR"}
