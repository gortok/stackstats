Became good enough at programming to earn a living.</p>\n\n<p>Swore like a sailor at other's bad code, refactored bad code, wrote bad code of my own. Swore at myself. Resolved to swear less.</p>\n\n<p>Was surprised that relational databases aren't a dry subject after all. Learned SQL. Started to enthusiastically use databases for everything, even in lieu of in-memory data structures. Came a bit off databases again: while it is possible to, say, write Tetris in SQL, it's not exactly advisable.</p>\n\n<p>Still learning, still curious, still toying around with various pet projects on the back burner (genetic algorithms, windows process hijacking, games).</p>\n","Location":"MÃ¼nster, Germany"}
