My goal (at the moment) is to study mathematics, but I also love programming (particularly in C#, C++, MSIL and x86 assembly language) and learning how things work on the lowest level (not only in computer science).</p>\n\n<p>I'm also experienced in PHP, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript (and a little bit in NodeJS, even if it is JS, but only in another runtime environment). I also tried other languages like Ruby or Python, but I lost interest in these languages very fast.</p>\n","Location":"Berlin, Germany"}
