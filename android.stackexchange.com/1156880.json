My experience with software is quite broad, but I now have some depth too with over 2 years experience in Android and iOS development.</p>\n\n<p>I started out programming Picaxes and moved onto 'proper' languages with VB6 and C#. I also had a little play with Java on the side to try that out. I have taken some small courses on Matlab and C++ at University and have had some time programming a PIC in C for a course project and using FreeRTOS for a University engineering society. I have experience in  a large Perl project and some basic web develoment (HTML, Javascript, DOJO) through an internship. Over the following couple of years I tried my hand at android and Java for a side project and another internship.</p>\n\n<p>So all in all, a reasonably wide experience of languages and have some depth too :)</p>\n","Location":"Cambridge, United Kingdom"}
