Build a game for it with two friends.\r\nThen moved to Amiga 500 and Motorola 680x0 series CPU.\r\nTook an education, learned C/C++ and some Pascal. Then worked in different companies and today I run my own small company working mostly with .NET and C#, but XHTML/CSS/XML + Flash Actionscript 3.0 is also part of my work sometimes.\r\n\r\nMy company is focusing on making the internet easier to learn and use.","Location":"Denmark"}
