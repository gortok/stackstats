Astronomy, quantum mechanics (and other physics domains), electrical/computer/mechanical/software engineering, neurology, psychology, biochemistry, molecular biology, virology, medicine in general, genetics. Impressionist and Romantic music, progressive metal, performance (cello, flute, and more!) and composing equally. Linguistics and the study of languages, and some aspects of sociology and philosophy, ethics, and humanities. Literature, fantasy/science fiction, Japanese manga/anime.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a programmer, electronics hobbyist (soon to be engineer!), fiction writer, musician, music composer, and illustrator.</p>\n","Location":"Montreal, Canada"}
