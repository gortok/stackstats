I've done research in c and Java, backend in Java and Node, NLP in Groovy, scala and some C# (Hate it, sorry), some web in Angular, toyed around with native android apps and was a part of building an ionic cross-platform app. </p>\n\n<p>I love tera-incognita, and rather walk the bleeding cutting edge. </p>\n\n<p>As Plutarch said – “The mind is a fire to be kindled , not a vessel to be filled.” . So far , I’ve never been cold.</p>\n","Location":"Israel"}
