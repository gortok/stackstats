I was working as an intern in Ambujex Technologies Pvt. Ltd,Bangalore for 6 months where I was trained in android. After that I have worked for 1.4 years in eNovate Media Solutions,Bangalore as Jr. Software Engineer. During this very crucial period I have worked on Lrnr(<a href=\"https://www.lrnr.us/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.lrnr.us/</a>) . Lrnr is a very innovative educational product with cross-platform support. I have been working with android client from scratch. I was very lucky to get such a small platform that has given enough opportunity to work with almost every corner of this product. Prior to this I was working with Pearson Prep for the GED Test(<a href=\"http://www.appszoom.com/android_applications/education/prep-for-the-ged-test_dbpfl.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.appszoom.com/android_applications/education/prep-for-the-ged-test_dbpfl.html</a>). Unfortunately, this app is unpublished by Pearson but you can get an idea from the above link.  I have been working with all the background processing with database designing and handling from scratch. I have also developed in-app module in this product. Apart from these products providing support to the team for fixing bugs in other pre-existing applications was very interesting. Posting solutions for my fellow developers, I like the most. I enjoy learning programming languages and reading technical news, blogs(engadget,android blog).</p>\n","Location":"Bangalore, India"}
