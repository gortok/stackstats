I like programming in anything related to JAVA, Python and C/C++. I really hate Php but I'm not of those ones who go and say:-\"Php is shit\". If a programming language has succeeded in the market is because is good or at least because It have a really big community supporting it. I love plain and simple algorithms, those ones like:-\"How can I find the rotation angle from this bullet to this watermelon?\". I really love develop games because they make you think as a programmer and not just configure some annoying xml to map the database. I love programming but I hate be a monkey programmer and be stuck configurating things.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I'M ZIM!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1tteU.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n","Location":"La Plata, Argentina"}
