I've worked on projects large and small, and have experience in more languages than I care to count (Java, ActionScript, Objective-C, JavaScript, C, C++, HTML, CSS, Velocity, SQL, Php, Bash, Perl, and probably others) and a number of different functional domains (concurrency/multiprogramming, build and test automation, server administration, team and project management, high-level design and architecture, etc.).  </p>\n\n<p>Notable open-source contributions include <a href=\"https://github.com/adam-roth/matchbook\" rel=\"nofollow\">matchbook</a>, a platform-agnostic matchmaking service, API, and SDK for mobile applications (think multi-platform real-time gaming), a <a href=\"https://github.com/adam-roth/coredata-threadsafe\" rel=\"nofollow\">thread-safe wrapper</a> for Apple's Core Data framework, and a <a href=\"https://github.com/adam-roth/screen-cap-view\" rel=\"nofollow\">screen-capture utility</a> for iOS.</p>\n\n<p>I've also self-published a <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003URRNCS\" rel=\"nofollow\">book</a> about self-publishing books, and a <a href=\"http://www.pieceable.com/view/bundle/bwx/80e4b/au.com.suncoastpc.Webcomix\" rel=\"nofollow\">comic reader app</a> for the iPhone.
