I use Laravel and Symfony2 for my website Developments, after outdated CodeIgniter. I super love raw Javascript without jQuery, that on its own sense, I'm also a jQuery admirer. AngularJS is my favorite Javascript Framework and I use it in cases required. I'm also seriously learning C++ to develops apps with it, as it is the Hero of all languages.</p>\n\n<p>Beside the above activities, I also do photoshop, Maya and After Effects. I love Motion Graphics and 3D Visualizations.</p>\n","Location":""}
