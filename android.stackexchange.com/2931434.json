I look forward for the breathtaking experience, Amazing ..Wouldn't it?</p>\n\n<p>Apart from my technical skills I am very good on identifying the business problems and and can suggest the approach to address that problem using technology. Working with TCS and few startups has given me confidence about the planning of the product development lifecycle. My working experience as freelancer has given me exposure to translate business requirements into technical requirement. Also being a team leader I can fill the gap between developers who are working in different technology in the same product. I can guide them to build the product with industry standards and if they get stuck on code then I don't mind folding my sleeve up to work with them whole night.</p>\n","Location":"Delhi, India"}
