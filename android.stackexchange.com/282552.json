Had some sysadmin experience (4 years+) and codes mostly in shell(bash) but is now also proficient in Perl(I still need to Google some solutions but I could now think in Perl). I could read a python code but don't rely on me to troubleshoot it(I'll learn about it later).</p>\n\n<p>Experience with open source systems is in installation and usage...most familiar with CentOS and Ubuntu, Apache, PHP and has a bit of knowledge in Qmail and MySQL. Virtualization experience is mostly in VMWare (the free version), Oracle VirtualBox and Parallels.</p>\n\n<p>I don't hate Microsoft Windows but I just like a Unix-like system (and I run cygwin now by the way) so I'm kinda at home with the CLI regardless of OS.</p>\n\n<p>Been experimenting with <a href=\"http://www.golang.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">golang</a> lately and loving it :)</p>\n","Location":"Cebu, Philippines"}
