I make really unique point of sale apps for the most part. I am an odd cookie in the fact that I have operated a rather large food and beverage related business in the past and now I make apps for food and beverage business owners. I am more of a designer than a programmer but I know a few things. My first app got over 25K downloads and it is not a game and doesn't play music. I think that's a pretty solid accomplishment. I don't use stack overflow to prop up my resume but simply to learn and perhaps help a newbie out when I can.</p>\n","Location":"Sol"}
