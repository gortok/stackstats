But I haven't really worked much on it. I have spent my career so far working on different database technologies doing extract, transform and load and performance optimization, on Linux and OpenVMS operating systems, which include the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Oracle (everybody knows Oracle). </li>\n<li>An objected oriented proprietary database technology that treats dimensions of time and currencies as integral part of the database. </li>\n<li>A key value store based proprietary database technology.</li>\n<li>SQLite</li>\n<li>HP's Vertica.</li>\n<li>SQL Server 2008</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And I mostly worked on coding in Object Oriented Perl.\nRecently though I've moved into web development, and have recently (since Jan 2013) started working on ASP .NET, C#, jQuery, HTML, Entity Framework and MS SQL Server for back-end.</p>\n","Location":""}
