I like debating philosophy. I recognize social values as well as individual values, and find interest in how these play out. I like logical positivism.</p>\n\n<p>I bicycle to work and ride with a club. I also walk at lunch instead of eating. I eat once a day in the evening, maybe to snack on chips a bit afterward.</p>\n\n<p>In my job and hobbies I actively do VB.net, VB6, C#, VBScript, javascript, PHP, Adobe Livecycle, Java, IBM mainframe COBOL, JCL, and Microsoft Access. I've been programming almost forty years, having started as a Customer Engineer as we were called back then, doing hardware. I began programming, writing troubleshooting software in assembler and FORTRAN to exercise the machine, then ISAM file recovery utilities, then applications. I've owned a company, been a consultant, and now enjoy being a state employee at a state agency. When not coding and remediating I do business analysis and some project management.</p>\n","Location":"Springfield, IL"}
