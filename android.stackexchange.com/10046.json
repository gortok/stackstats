I swear there are days I marvel that she doesn't snap out of it and decide she can do far better :) . . . but I’m very glad she doesn’t. <br/></p>\n\n<p>My second love for many years would have been C++, which has been pushed out by C#, very powerful, very concise. <br/></p>\n\n<p>I often work with Vb, but I dislike it, being much more enamoured of the curly brace than I am of hugely verbose syntax.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Although it’s many years since we last parted, I still hold a grudge against Vb3, 4, 5 &amp; 6, oh, and all flavours of VBA. Languages that are, IMHO, as wrong and unholy as . . . well . . .  something that’s <em>really</em> wrong and unholy (pick your own desecration and go with that imagery, I’m not going to do all the work for you). . . there are whole years I spent bleeding and blistered on the Pre Vb.Net cross . . . and I’m glad I can say “never again”.<br/></p>\n","Location":"Dublin, Ireland"}
