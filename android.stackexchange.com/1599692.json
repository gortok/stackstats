Now I code for a living working mainly in JavaScript/AngularJS/NodeJS when I can choose and Java/Groovy/Grails when I have to.  I'm particularly excited by Angular 2, which I think is a great model for building applications.</p>\n\n<p>For fun, I like to build mobile apps using Apache Cordova (PhoneGap), Ionic, and AngularJS for the Android and iOS platforms.  I mostly use Twitter Bootstrap as a CSS/HTML framework, but am also familiar with Foundation. </p>\n\n<p>#SOreadytohelp</p>\n","Location":"Yardley (Greater Philadelphia), PA 19067"}
