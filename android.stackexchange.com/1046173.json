Wannabe Agile team member.</p>\n\n<p>Although I probably contributed a lot to whatever processor you are using to read this on, I am a software guy at heart. HW guys call me a SW guy, SW guys call me a HW guy.</p>\n\n<p>In my copious free time I am maintaining and adding to a wiki on Computer Architecture, <a href=\"http://comp-arch.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://comp-arch.net</a></p>\n\n<p>C/C++ programmer (that's what HW simulators get written in).</p>\n\n<p>Code performance tuning.  (Heck, not only did I contribute to the architecture of a large part of the CPU you are using, I may have done the same for the hardware that you use to measure performance on it.)</p>\n\n<p>Database: author of Perl SQL (not yet another interface to an SQL RDBMS - instead I implemented SQL to query experiment data in flat files). (You may still be able to find it on CPAN, although be kind, it was my first object oriented Perl (4?) code.) An early member of the NoSQL movement, although I am not so much against SQL, as I am against heavyweight databases with inflexible schema.</p>\n\n<p>XML evangelist.</p>\n\n<p>Wannabe user interface designer/programmer.</p>\n\n<p>Wannabe Agile team member: I love pair programming and test driven design, and want to do it in my day job.</p>\n\n<p>Proud to be Canadian, hence my domain glew.ca.  But US Permanent Resident, have lived 20+ years in Portland, Oregon (and Illinois, and Silicon Valley, and Seattle area).</p>\n\n<p>Or you can use the domain comp-arch.net</p>\n\n<p>DISCLAIMER:</p>\n\n<p>The content of my posts, whether on this website or anywhere else, are my personal opinion only.
