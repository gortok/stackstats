In the beginning of my career, being in the marketing department of a big telecom company, which hardly added any values to my curiosity, I was hell-bent to jump into the software because that was the only way to know about the nitty-gritty of the hardcore technical aspects. Hence I started with learning C++/VC++. But in the beginning it was really difficult without much idea about programming. Moreover, there was no google. I took a little more time to pick up. There was no training. Absolutely no help from anybody. No broadband internet. No computer at home. It was really difficult for me. But I did not stop dreaming. I used to dream and tell my colleagues that C++ is not as much about programming as about designing. It is more about a technique for moving from the problem domain to the solution domain. However, I hardly got any supports from the organizations where I worked. It was only when I got a PC at home, I started walking towards my goal. The early morning rise, innumerable visits to technical book stores in Bangalore, googling and traversing from one link to another in search for technical and C++ contents, becoming tired after the office hours, all were part of it. But still the road was difficult. I was not able to join the dots. And then when I started going through the Design Pattern book, the actual joy of learning began. Still I remember how I used to go through the MFC source code to map different GoF patterns in Doc-View architecture, the command-routing architecture and so forth. However, I was not much aware of the Open Source communities. Then when Google made their Android framework open, it was a boon for me. I picked up many unknown areas and started looking into code from a designer’s perspective. When i started understanding the Android framework code, I thought I was really able to join the dots.The dots between the dream and the reality to become an able software engineer…..</p>\n","Location":"Bangalore, India"}
