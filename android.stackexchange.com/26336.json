He was built inspite of compiler warnings, hence the occasional NullPointer exceptions with low caffeine consumption. When asked to describe him he had this to say; \"I like Coding stuff with my non-bare hands (I wear LaTeX gloves), I also like playing unicorn polo (its a thing, instead of real horses we use unicorns and insted real balls we use dragonballz) on the frickin MOON. Also Jimi Hendrix is GOD.\"</p>\n","Location":"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"}
