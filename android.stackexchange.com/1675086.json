I also sometimes spend a tremendous amount of time doing something really useless, but don't realize it until I feel tired and it's 5am.\nOr... I meet people, yeah I can also go out =)</p>\n\n<p>Anytime of day, I'm a refactoring addict, I like to find the right name for things, and place each thing in the right place. Code is often full of compromises, but I try to get the best of all worlds whenever possible.</p>\n","Location":"Antibes, France"}
