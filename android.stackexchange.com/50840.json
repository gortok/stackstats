He prefers NoSQL over relational databases and can refactor like a mad banshee. </p>\n\n<p>He loves programming, so much so that he dreams in code and has nightmares about legacy code.  He wears Transformers pajamas.</p>\n\n<p>A few years ago, he staged a full-scale coup d'état and burned down the ivory tower where the software architects lived.  Then, he sang and frolicked and danced about with the rest of the lowly software developers.</p>\n\n<p>When he’s angry, he mumbles to himself and types more loudly on his keyboard.  When he’s happy he mumbles to himself and types loudly on his keyboard as well.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about his blathering and rants on his blog: <a href=\"http://blog.jonathanoliver.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.jonathanoliver.com/</a></p>\n","Location":"Salt Lake City, Utah"}
