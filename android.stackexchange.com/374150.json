I've had my experiences with ActionScript (RIP Flash), HTML/JavaScript/CSS, Python, Ruby/Rails, VB.NET and others, but none of those deep enough to be able to answer questions around here (I did ask a few, though). Last year I started my PhD in Bioinformatics using R, and I have finally learned enough to start helping instead of only being helped!</p>\n","Location":"Brazil"}
