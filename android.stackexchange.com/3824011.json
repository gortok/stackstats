Besides there is unacceptable 2 - hands voting, and it should be eliminated , but in my opinion it isn't, there are really ordinary answers which has support strongly disproportionate to its real value, compare scientific value of:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/413950/proving-abel-dirichlets-test-for-convergence-of-improper-integrals-using-integr/415017#415017\">Proving Abel-Dirichlet&#39;s test for convergence of improper integrals using Integration by parts</a></p>\n\n<p>and this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/116269/how-can-adding-an-infinite-number-of-rationals-yield-an-irrational-number/116270#116270\">How can adding an infinite number of rationals yield an irrational number?</a></p>\n\n<p>, what is chatty, bit trolling (Mariano Su√°rez-Alvarez is tending here to ridicule the question) and is not solution if somebody is looking for an answer how to prove that $\\pi$ is not rational number.<br>\nIf \"-1 - comment\" is reported by other user, then could exist possibility of canceling it if it is NOT constructive, etc. S.c \"hating\" can cause that good answers are considered as wrong ones.
