In my experience, it does not pay off. Keeping up good quality with a talented team of developers is the cheapest solution already in a year's scale. Find those guys from development who understand business priorities and communicate with them openly. Do not push them to the limit or you will loose much more caused by the bad quality and increased turnaround.</p>\n\n<p>My goal is to build a team that produces quality software. To achieve this goal I always improve both social and professional skills and keep in touch with talented people I would like to have in that team.</p>\n\n<p>skills: extreme programming, certified scrum master, coach, configuration management, OOP, UML, C++, Python, Java, C#</p>\n","Location":"Hungary"}
