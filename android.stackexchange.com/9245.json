My blend of traditional system administration and custom software solutions has allowed numerous enterprises to transcend platform dependence. Some of my software is still in use at a state university in Michigan.</p>\n\n<p>Recently I have written software to manage specific applications deployed across hundreds of Unix servers and thousands of Windows servers remotely via a Web Management Interface. The system works without an agent utilizing standard Unix remote management protocols such as SSH.</p>\n\n<p>Currently I am an independent contractor working on Windows Forms applications for tuning embedded software control modules for a US auto manufacturer. I spend my free time writing more software, baking, and watching far too much television.</p>\n\n<p>Baking is great. I highly recommend growing your own yeast!</p>\n\n<p>All that is nice, but I should start at the beginning. I was born. I begged to be taught to read, but waited until formal school. Around age 6 - I’m not exactly sure when - I learned TRS-80 compatible basic on a Sharp 1500 (Radio Shack PC2) pocket computer. My parents encouraged this by borrowing a VIC20 from my uncle for a few months before purchasing the family an Atari 800XL for Christmas around the time I was 7 or 8.</p>\n\n<p>Atari 800XL was WAY better than Commodore 64 in the only area that mattered to me: BASIC. I had drawing primitives. LINE, CIRCLE and PAINT functions - or were they called subroutines - were available. I loved me some drawing. In 1987 around the time I turned 10, my family upgraded to a used Amiga 1000, with the 512K option. Thanks to the AmigaBasic 1.2 and 1.3 provided by Microsoft, I was now writing basic without line numbers. This was like QBasic or QuickBasic on a PC available years later. I struggled endless hours trying to make the North C compiler compile my hello world app. I never succeeded.</p>\n\n<p>Age 14 in 1990, Dad buys the family - me - my first “PC”, a 4</p>\n","Location":"Ann Arbor, MI"}
