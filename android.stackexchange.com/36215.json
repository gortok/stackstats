Not everything President Gerald Ford said was very smart or worth repeating, but this is</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The USA was designed as a Constitutional Republic, with checks-and-balances between the branches of the federal government, and also division of power between federal state and local governments.  (And these are explicitly required by the plain language of the Constitution)  All government officials need to stay within the authority granted to them by the Constitution, especially when that means they can't do whatever they want.</p>\n","Location":"Houston, TX"}
