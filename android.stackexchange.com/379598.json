Wallis Budge, <em>The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is impossible to disassociate language from science or science from\n  language, because every natural science always involves three things:\n  the sequence of phenomena on which the science is based, the abstract\n  concepts which call these phenomena to mind, and the words in which\n  the concepts are expressed. To call forth a concept, a word is needed;\n  to portray a phenomenon, a concept is needed. All three mirror one and\n  the same reality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Antoine Lavoisier, 1789</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[L]ogic, in so far as it exhibits the universal and necessary laws of\n  the understanding, must in these very laws present us with criteria of\n  truth. Whatever contradicts these rules is false, because thereby the\n  understanding is made to contradict its own universal laws of thought;\n  that is, to contradict itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, I, 2nd Part, II.
