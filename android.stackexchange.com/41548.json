I was first exposed to programming in BASIC on the APPLE II while I was still a grade school student, and have been hooked to various degrees since.</p>\n\n<p>I am currently studying and writing in VB.NET, C#(+XNA), and to a lesser extent C++ and various flavors of HTML and web languages. I've also been reading and hoping to study more about Assembly(intel,arm,6502) and C in order to get a better grasp on low level operations.</p>\n\n<p>I also make a couple of pieces of open source software, for MP3 playlists, and cellphone technicians.
