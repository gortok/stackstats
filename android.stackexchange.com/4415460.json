Forever working towards the brighter side of the grey area between incompetence and competence. I know enough about a wide range of subjects to get myself into trouble, and know enough about some of said subjects to divert the trouble as well.</p>\n\n<p>As far as programming languages are concerned, I'm most familiar with bash (and its family), Java, HTML, and CSS. I've also toyed with C, C++, Haxe (and the Haxepunk libraries), Lua, Ruby, and Python. Please don't ever make me handle serious GUI development with Java, I will literally die. I <em>can</em> use vi and similar editors, I simply choose not to. I can use regex rather well. If there is a strange way of doing something, that's the way I'll end up doing it unless instructed otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Way too interested in music, mountains, cooking, game development, art, science, and electrical engineering. As interested but not as invested in reading, gardening, psychology, philosophy, history, and foreign languages. I love learning new things and helping others learn what I know- your knowledge isn't any good if it dies with you.</p>\n\n<p>Arguably a nice enough fellow~</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
