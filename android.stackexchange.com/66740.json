(Previously, I've developed WCF web services including Mountain Dew's DEWmocracy, Game Fuel, and Honor the Code; the Pepsi account management system; and the Pepsi Product Facts website.)  My personal projects have led me through WPF, WF, WinRT, DNX, and many others. I've toyed a bit with Xamarin and MonoGame. I've also worked extensively with AngularJS, and a bit with KnockoutJS. I have also occasionally worked with PHP.</p>\n","Location":"Cincinnati, OH"}
