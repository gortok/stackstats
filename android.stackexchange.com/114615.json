For some reason instead of getting NES or PS, i've got Sinclair ZX for New Year Eve and after a while I got really excited with what you can get, writing number lines of code.</p>\n\n<p>I tried and played with a lot of stuff including prolog, lisp, c , turbo pascal, delphi, basic, bash, javascript, vb, vbscript</p>\n\n<p>I truly love javascript and really like where is it moving last 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>I'm working mainly on three platforms</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>.net (c#, iis, asp.net, sql server, wcf etc)</li>\n<li>MEAN stack (javascript, node.js, express.js, mongo, angular.js)</li>\n<li>Python (flask, web.py)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After trying and playing with number of client-side MV** frameworks, I stick with angular.js for now, waiting when polymer/platform became more stable.</p>\n\n<p>However later I'm trying to step back from angular and do something similar to basecamp next approach, when again you render html on the server side.</p>\n\n<p>Funny to say but I see later (polymer) like client side asp.net. </p>\n\n<p>I've got MSPD .net 4.0 Web Developer certification (MCTS WCF 4.0, ADO.NET 4.0, ASP.NET 4.0)</p>\n\n<p>My story with JS started with IE6 and client side calculators for totaling clients expenses on pre-print media, that was quite long time ago, when there was no AJAX buzz word.  I moved to jquery, RICO, prototype and back to jquery, and was using mostly it since version 1.2. Also I was using ASP.NET AJAX for almost 10 years and find it to be quite under-valued framework.</p>\n\n<p>I'm collecting 30 lines or less javascript examples, feel free to add yours <a href=\"http://30lines.info\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://30lines.info</a></p>\n","Location":"United States"}
