I also enjoy web development with jQuery and have tried some console projects with C++. One of my \"best\" personal projects is my Chrome Extension <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/potato-it/lbkdijklknadgammeolepeachokdbnll\" rel=\"nofollow\">Potato It!</a>. I'm extremely surprised that almost 300 people have the extension! (My expectations are extremely low. And it's my most used project so far.)</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I know that I can have separate bios for different sites, I just choose not to. Deal with it.</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
