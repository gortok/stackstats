I am very much self-taught, using books, manuals and sites like stackoverflow to help me improve my skills.  My job titles have been everything from Business Analyst to Report Developer and now, Quality Data Analyst.  In a nutshell, I write stored procedures to create reports.  I have some experience with Oracle, but I prefer SQL Server.  For reporting tools, I have mainly worked with Crystal Reports, but I have some experience in Cognos and SSRS.  If I were to have my way, I'd never work with Crystal again and would instead focus on SSRS.  However; I'm not the one who gets to choose the reporting package.  I'm thrilled about my new position which is developing solutions that use external and internal data to build solid reports to serve our providers and patients.  Making a difference in people's lives via technology is a goal of mine and being able to do it on a daily basis is a thrill.</p>\n\n<p>In my spare time, I've become the crazy cat lady in my neighborhood - I now own 3 - and I like to hangout with my grandsons (no, I'm not old enough, thank you for noticing - they're steps).  I, also, have an American Eskimo Dog - Oliver - who is a bit of a challenge.  In order to train your dog, you really need to be smarter than he is and Ollie is giving me and my family quite the run for our money.</p>\n\n<p>I love to read.  I have books in every room and am never far from one.  I download cozy mysteries to my phone via Kindle, so I'm never caught waiting without something to read.  I just finished reading, \"The Martian\" and I've just started \"Eighty Days\" by Matthew Goodman.</p>\n\n<p>I own a PS4 and I am currently obsessed with Assassin's Creed: Unity. My online handle is BentleyGadget, if you ever want to play with someone who loves the game, but really sucks at it! 8-)</p>\n","Location":"Wisconsin"}
