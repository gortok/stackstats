I started with early PHP things like \ne107, Joomla, MODx, later transferred to more avanced tools (frameworks): Symfony, CodeIgnighter and <em>Zend Framework</em> (which I still use for some projects). Finally when I felt too academic for PHP, I switched to Python (considered Ruby also). While on Python I tried <em>Django</em> but chose a less coupled framework <em>Pyramid</em> for daily use.</p>\n\n<p>**Note: For such a long webdev career I have suprisingly few things to share and to be proud of. The reason is probably lack of time and motivation to perfectly document and put projects for public use. Or simply maybe because I am too shy/coward. I am trying to fix that though:)*</p>\n","Location":"Chon Buri, Thailand"}
