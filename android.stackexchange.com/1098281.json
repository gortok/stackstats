Otherwise, I have rudimentary experience in Python, Java, C/C++, LaTeX. And bits and pieces of PHP.</p>\n\n<p>I much prefer to use *nix over Windows, because that way I can do most things without leaving the keyboard. I would be gladly proven wrong, but I think the command-line interface is one of the most user-friendly there is around. (You just have to know how it selects its friends.)</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to sing along and edit this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I want to teach the world to C, in perfect gcc,<br>\n  With makefiles set, and no regrets (and please, no .exe)!<br>\n  The backslash breaks a path in parts, and not the other slash.<br>\n  Don't slash both ways, it hurts so bad, for options? Use a dash!</p>\n  \n  <p>If you have got a great idea, then share it with us all!<br>\n  All the credit goes to you for making the right call.<br>\n  But who's to say there's no one else to make it much better?<br>\n  You'll never know if you don't share, and we'd all just suffer.</p>\n  \n  <p>I hope to teach the world to share, the ideas we have made<br>\n  More money's cool, but if we don't have it, how would you get paid?<br>\n  It started as a *nixxy rant, but now it's more than that,<br>\n  We are born human, so let's not race as if we were just rats.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","Location":"Singapore, Singapore"}
