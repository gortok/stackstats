Skilled in Network Administration, File Servers, and Windows Workstations and other related systems. I enjoy providing inventive direction and out of the box thinking.  Values commitment to excellence, innovation, and customer service.</p>\n\n<p>I have been a windows man since windows 1.  I have been and IT person for a little over 27 years, and I totally love it.\n  I have been using windows, and MAC OS, and I have to say that I liked MAC OS better than windows, and I have been using it for about 10 years now.  A dear friend was telling me about Ubuntu about a month ago, so I went ahead and downloaded it and installed it on a trial basis, but  it turned out that I have a new OS.  Since I have removed windows from my machine, and have been using Ubuntu since.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/1454782/mitch\"><img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/1454782.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for Mitch on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for Mitch on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" /></a></p>\n","Location":"GMT +3:00"}
