I have a dog and love aquatic life. I do not like iOS due to it being not very versatile and I like the Linux based Android with a long-term love for linux and it's versatility. Currently working on developing some games for android. A bit more recently I've been doing more Java. You can find me on my blog at teenkoder.blogspot.com</p>\n\n<p>I am a freelancer and also offer services including tutoring, teaching, and code review.
