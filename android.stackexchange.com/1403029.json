Most recently I've found myself coding in C#, especially SQLCLR inside SQL Server.  I'm currently squeezing every ounce of performance I can out of SQL Server, and occasionally get frustrated at not being able to \"describe\" to SQL Server what it is that I actually want it to do.  If only there was a \"friendly\" way to explicitly specify the execution plan I wanted!</p>\n","Location":"Sydney, Australia"}
