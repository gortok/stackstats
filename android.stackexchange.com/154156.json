I started on the TRS-80 Model and have worked on everything from DEC-10s to 8051s and pretty much everything in between. I've done machine control, instrumentation, web backends and frontends, security and probably other things that I can't remember at the moment. I have a tendency to solve thorny problems in a slightly \"backward\" way and am very good at leaping into a large code base and figuring out what the problems are.</p>\n","Location":"Phoenix, AZ"}
