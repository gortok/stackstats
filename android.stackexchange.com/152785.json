I've been slowly helping them achieve a self sufficient environment by implementing open source operating systems and tools, and developing custom applications and automated processes.  Our development stacks extensively involved PHP, Python, Django, C# (winforms), and Sharepoint.  Our heterogeneous environment is comprised of Windows and Debian GNU/Linux, Exim, Bind, Active Directory, Exchange, Mysql, Postgresql, MS Sql, various security &amp; encryption tools, and various custom and specialized commercial software packages.</p>\n\n<p>I am interested in doing contract or part-time employment for development, project management,  or software engineering &amp; architectural work for companies who can be geographically flexible (which should be anyone in this modern day).</p>\n","Location":"Milwaukee, WI"}
