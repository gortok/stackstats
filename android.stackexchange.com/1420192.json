I plan to become a programmer. I am interested in many related Open Source projects. I have multiple years of experience in AMD proprietary driver \"fglrx\" and its command \"amdconfig\". I am the administrator of a project called HL:Exp Mobile. We are a team who are porting Half-Life: Opposing Force and Half-Life: Blue Shift to Unity3D engine and make it run on mobile phones. (Find us on moddb or Facebook). I am also interested in projects like The Zeitgeist Movement and The Venus Project. I hope to meet Linus Torvalds some day.</p>\n","Location":"Toronto, Canada"}
