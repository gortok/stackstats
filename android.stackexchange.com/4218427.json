Thank you so much elder and young people for your participation, helping answers and important questions.</p>\n\n<p>I have been working as a software engineer since 2000. It is mostly embedded application developing. I often write or modify/port device drivers. All projects I was involved in I worked at low level programming with deep digging to a hardware specification. I managed with inner mechanisms of a number of RTOSes.</p>\n\n<p>I am a Software Engineer at </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.topconpositioning.com/sites/all/themes/tps/logo.png\" alt=\"Topcon logo\"> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://global.topcon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Topcon</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://s.c.lnkd.licdn.com/scds/common/u/img/webpromo/btn_myprofile_160x33.png\" alt=\"Linkedin logo\"></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://au.linkedin.com/pub/ruslan-gerasimov/24/a8b/3b8/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Linkedin</strong> profile</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/4218427.png\" alt=\"Ruslan Gerasimov&#39;s reputation summary on StackExchange\"></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/4218427/ruslan-gerasimov?tab=accounts\"><strong>Stack Exchange</strong> profile</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My story of engineering started with my first program that I had written at the age of eleven (11) years old. That was a little arcade game in pseudo-graphic written in Basic, based on ZX Spectrum compliant machine. The same year, in 1991, I realized importance and advantages of coding in Assembler, so I learnt Z80 Zilog's assembler instructions set and got my experience with it. From the 1998 I started working with microcontrollers at university lab, which was a mix of ASMs and C/C++. To sum up, I coded in a variety assemblers and architectures such as x86, Motorola HC08, AVR Atmega, PIC and ARM-7. From 2003 till now I have been working with C/C++ mostly as embedded engineer.</p>\n\n<p>There were a several periods I worked with VHDL for ALTERA and XILINX FPGAs. Then I had my expertise with RTOSes (uC/OS-II, RTEMS). I also had a big experience with low-level developing like device drivers, data buses, protocols an so on. A number of drivers I have written from scratch, such as I2C, SPI, CAN, FAT, USB mass storage class. During the last years there were many chips I write support for, such as EEPROM, LED controller, battery charger/monitor, Ethernet PHY, variety of tiny I2C chips with different functions.</p>\n\n<p><kbd><strong>None of zeros and ones has suffered at writing this autobiography :P</strong></kbd></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pche3.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n","Location":"Brisbane, Australia"}
