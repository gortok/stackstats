I want to find the perfect test - how is it structured; how does it read; how does it link to business requirements; what patterns are used to make the test semantic; what considerations are there to make the test maintainable?</p>\n\n<p>Until you have tested code, it doesn't work.\nIf it is difficult to test code, at best it is unmaintainable.  At worst, it is unmaintainable and it doesn't work.</p>\n\n<p>That's why many of the questions I answer here are about Specflow.</p>\n\n<p>In my spare time, I'm into C++ indie games development.</p>\n","Location":"London, United Kingdom"}
