I have cerebral palsy so computers have been my best, and I've got the most out of them. I've taught myself AutoIt, Java, and a bit of most web languages, including PHP and HTML, as now own about six domains and I'm in the process of starting my own business. I don't confess to know everything about anything and I know I have A LOT to learn but I do what I can and try to help out where I can. I think I'm the biggest 'Guru' of the family!</p>\n","Location":""}
