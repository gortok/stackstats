I am working in Dell Software Group as a Gold Support Network Security Engineer.</p>\n\n<p>I have done MCSE, RHCE and CCIE courses and I am curious about the skills in OS or the Kernel level. Looking for a good platform to prove my skills. What I am doing in organisation is just serving my </p>\n\n<p>daily needs but I am still thirsty to gain knowledge, I am looking for something which I can experiment / research and develop. I am not looking for any money for doing this, all I am looking for is to </p>\n\n<p>get satisfied by redesigning or giving something new to the technology.</p>\n\n<p>I have a programming knowledge on DOS (Windows Batch Scripting) and Linux Bash Scripting. I have also worked on firewalls and penetration testing tools but for some reason I am still not satisfied, </p>\n\n<p>I wanna deep dive into the OS kernel level and to get wondered.</p>\n\n<p>From your end I am looking for a good platform where I can test/research and dedicate a great thing to the IT.</p>\n\n<p>I can be reached at my cell: +91 9480001033 and email: manjesh_n@hotmail.com.</p>\n\n<p>Hoping for the best from your end at the earliest.</p>\n\n<p>Regards,</p>\n\n<p>Man</p>\n","Location":"Bengaluru, India"}
