I have one app on the app store, which is an app that teachers can use to help streamline their running records for reader's workshop conferences.  It was my wife's idea (she is  4th grade teacher) and was my final project for Coding Together.</p>\n\n<p>By day, I am an R&amp;D manager at Itron, Inc. where we develop tools to help utilities deliver gas, water, and electricity to people all over the world as efficiently and affordably as possible.</p>\n","Location":"Spokane, WA"}
