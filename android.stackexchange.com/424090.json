Very passionate about technology, the way it is evolving and what it has to offer. I'm a fan of <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Scala</strong>, <strong>Objective-C</strong>, and <strong>Hypermedia APIs</strong>. I mainly work with opensource tools, because of their flexibility, the power they have to offer and most importantly the community of developers that helps to build and enhance them. Also, I occasionally dabble in <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Android</strong> to build cool stuff, but my primary area of concentration is creating Web Applications. So, I've started to venture into the deep end of various web frameworks to learn how they work and why they work the way they do and also to get a better understanding of how to create better <em>APIs</em>, because my aim is to contribute to a better web experience in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kareypowell\" rel=\"nofollow\">@kareypowell</a></p>\n","Location":"Jamaica"}
