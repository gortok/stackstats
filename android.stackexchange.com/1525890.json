I love learning.  At the time of writing this I am 23 years old and live in Houston, TX.  I was born in West Palm Beach, Florida, grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, and went to school in Houston, Texas at Rice University.</p>\n\n<p>At Rice I received two degrees: one in Physics and one in Mathematics.  I love both.  I never received any formal education on Computer Science, however, you will find that most of this blog will be about programming and web development. Nevertheless, I think being a good programmer is about being good at learning, and thinking logically about how to solve problems - of which I think my educational background has more than covered.</p>\n\n<p>Since high-school, I had found that the easiest way to make money was by programming.  Programming started off as a hobby and small interest, and slowly grew into a passion.</p>\n\n<p>I have recently started working on a new startup here in Houston, TX.  I wont bore you with the details of that just yet, but I am very excited about it and I think we can do big things.  We plan to launch our project this year at SXSW 2013.  What I will say for now, is that we would like to create a company of talented software developers who are similarly ambitious and want to create cool stuff (and have fun doing it).</p>\n","Location":""}
