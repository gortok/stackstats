I'm self learned in C#, VBA, and a little VB6 mixed in, and my next goal is to try to learn Java.</p>\n\n<p>I'm always looking to know more about C#, LINQ, XML, and XSD, and throw in some SQL as well.</p>\n\n<p>In my personal life, aside from my precious time with my family, I enjoy golf in addition to the aforementioned programming, as well as new technology.  I build computers once in a while and am running my own Home Theater PC.</p>\n","Location":"Pennsylvania"}
