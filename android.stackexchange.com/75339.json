I just try to get things done, without fancy paradigms.  I think that design and development frameworks are great, because they give a good backbone to build upon.  \r\n\r\nOne thing I dislike more than anything, is re-designing the wheel.  If its already done, I want to use it, and move on to my next task.  I don't want to waste my time doing work thats already been done elsewhere.","Location":"Waconia, MN"}
