Pick the\n    wrong ones, and programming will be a series of nasty surprises:\n    interfaces will become baroque and clumsy as they are forced to\n    accommodate unanticipated interactions, and even the simplest of\n    changes will be hard to make.\"</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>Daniel Jackson, MIT Professor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","Location":"Montreal, Canada"}
