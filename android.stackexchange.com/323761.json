(Include the first name, though, or you'll get my cousin Russ (http://www.eyrie.org/~rra)....)</p>\n\n<p>Presently I am unemployed and looking at jobs in the Toronto area. Most recently I was a senior system administrator for Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, a department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology half of CMU. Most of my work is infrastructure â€” the stuff most people don't notice unless it's broken. My job is to make sure people continue to not notice it.</p>\n\n<p>I have been suffering from gradually worsening sinus problems for the past 10 years, and I was recently diagnosed with dysphoric bipolar syndrome. A fair amount of this journal is about the latter. More recent items are tagged so they can be avoided. I may at some point go back and fix the earlier ones.</p>\n\n<p>In the 90s (that is, before the dysphoric bipolar got bad enough that I had trouble focusing in projects) I was involved with a number of open source projects. I'm starting to find my way back into the open source world now that I'm regaining reliable control of my faculties.</p>\n","Location":"Akron, OH"}
