I had never saved an effort to prove myself as one the of best students in this subject, every exam I had, every test, every experiment speaks about me and the results speaks of itself. My academic experience was the main reason for what I learned in software development, programming and algorithms and as we grow, knowledge grows with us. Developing and keeping check of software and programs is not an easy task, developing a database or an algorithm can take quite a lot of time, detecting and fixing complex bugs sometimes can be nerve wrecking, therefore I’m determined to cope up with such routine tasks. My curiosity always push me to think outside the box and get me out of my comfort zone, that’s why I always try to take things apart and put them back together.</p>\n","Location":"Tunisia"}
