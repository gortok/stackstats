I'll update it later/sometime/maybe<br/>\n<br/>\nReletively new coder, a recent graduate of the computer science program from the Engineering College at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nVim fan - a pro at an internship impressed me. Still learning how to extend/customize it with plugins to make it do exactly what I want.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, c++ is a difficult, powerful language. Some people don't like all the boilerplate, but I like how it lays everything on the table. Is it possible to get to the point where I can code \"on the fly\", not needing to second-guess the decisions I make?<br/>\n<br/>\nNot very familiar with Python yet, but I'm definitely going to start my next project with it. I really like its simplicity, its practical \"high-level-ness\", its libraries, and its mantra that \"there is a way it <i>should</i> be done.\"</p>\n","Location":"San Francisco, CA"}
