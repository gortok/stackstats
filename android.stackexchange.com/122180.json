I like to surround myself with people who are just as or more hardworking and ambitious than I am.</p>\n\n<p>I love getting carried away in the possibilities of a cool new idea.</p>\n\n<p>A programmer by trade, I'm a polyglot: I'm fluent in many different programming languages and can tune myself into the nuances of a new language fairly easily. I started coding when I was 12, and my fingers (and imagination) have been on fire ever since.</p>\n","Location":"Scotland, United Kingdom"}
