Ever-since I installed it I keep understanding more and more about the big big picture of how computer systems and programs work! I imagine the world with Ubuntu (or generally Linux) as the most popular computer operating system, It would then be much better!!</p>\n\n<p>I have a comment about askubuntu. Keep it simple! The questions don't need to be so sophisticated and full of technicalities (although that's okay). It can be just something about Ubuntu that you want to tweak. Or maybe about some strange object that you don't understand. Or even something about Ubuntu's history! ...Just enjoy helping people know Ubuntu better :)</p>\n","Location":"Cairo, Egypt"}
