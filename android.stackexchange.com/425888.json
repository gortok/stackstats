It quickly became my favorite game. Ever since then I have been intrigued by computers and programming languages. There are 41 languages in which I have written at least one program. My favorite languages are PHP and C# with Java coming in a close third because of Android. I continue to learn more every day and try to keep up with todayâ€™s advancing technologies.
