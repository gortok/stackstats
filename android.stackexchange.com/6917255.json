In high school, I was the lead programmer on a robotics team. Since I started coding about 10 years ago I have grown in both practical and theoretical knowledge, and I now consider myself to be a pretty solid coder. Last month, I was even able to make an Android app from scratch (see link). With my current level of knowledge, I am confident that I can provide accurate answers on Stack Overflow. Furthermore,recently I started learning CJam so I could compete at the Programming Puzzles and Code Golf page. I also recently graduated with a B.A in Applied Mathematics from the University of Southern California</p>\n","Location":"Los Angeles, CA"}
