I love my wife, our children, computers, playing guitar (especially singing/playing for my wife and/or kids), bicycling (including taking my kids for rides in my bike trailer), woodworking, airbrushing, digital and traditional artistry, playing games with my family (traditional and digital), my poor Chevette that I had to sell, throwing knives, firearms, knot tying, rope making, whip making, and really just learning new stuff in general. If I don't know about it I probably want to learn about it, if only so I can make informed decisions about it.</p>\n\n<p><p>\nMy three favorite programming languages are Python, Lisp, and Assembly (though I'm not sure about the order of those last two languages...).</p>\n\n<p>I think the CANSPAM act is one of the dumbest pieces of legislation in the history of the universe</p>\n\n<p>I love Python and HTML+Javascript.</p>\n\n<p>I'm #SOreadytohelp (I really want a t-shirt, what can I say?)</p>\n","Location":"Greenwood, AR"}
