I've had a strong relationship with programming since Gymnasium but decided to not focus only on software engineering. So as of now I'm kind of <em>not an expert</em> in any specific field but gathered knowledge in both mechanical engineering (medium to advanced), electrical engineering (basic understanding) and software engineering (advanced).<br>\nI love to <strong>bring these skills together</strong> by automating engineering tools like CATIA or Siemens NX. Although I focused on the software side a little, recently.<br>\nAlso I really like to mediate between teams of the different domains, knowing both <em>ways of thought</em>, that use to make it hard for mechanical engineers to talk to software engineers and vice versa.</p>\n","Location":""}
