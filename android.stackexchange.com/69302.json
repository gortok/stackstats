I tinker with a lot of languages and platforms, and have a background of both Desktop apps and Web Apps. My strongest languages are C, C++, PHP and C# right now. I try to be as Polyglot as possible.\n<br /><br />\nI can be pretty wordy sometimes, but I love programming, and I love helping people. If my war and peace sized explanations help someone learn it's worth the space.\n<br /><br />\nIf you want people to continue to help out, give them credit for it, it takes less than a second to hit that arrow!<br /><br /></p>\n","Location":"Gaston, OR"}
