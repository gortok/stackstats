Still, it gave me chance to get to know MVC a lot more through <a href=\"https://github.com/Mach-II/Mach-II-Framework\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mach-II</a>. When ASP.NET MVC came out, I felt I had a good advantage, and had would have a stronger knowledge than if I had continued using 'classic' ASP.NET webforms.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoy the fact that stackoverflow is more community based than Experts Exchange, which really makes users feel isolated.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I've answered more questions in the two months here, than I did in five years at <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=experts+exchange+scam\" rel=\"nofollow\">Experts Exchange</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Initially spurred on by the challenge of \"doing better than <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/261677/jonathon-bolster\">Jonathon Bolster</a>\", I found that helping out is extremely enjoyable and helping people of all technical skill levels is great fun.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that I am <strong>not</strong> currently looking for further employment. :)</p>\n","Location":"United Kingdom"}
