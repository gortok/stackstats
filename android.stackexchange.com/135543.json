I've been in this industry long enough to know that syntax is just syntax and software design is much more than the particulars of which language you are using (today).</p>\n\n<p>I am also an entrepreneur; I have my own consulting practice and have participated in StartupWeekend twice.  I am currently leading conversations to change the way the software industry perceives the patent system; teaching developers the importance of software patents and leading to improvements in how the system works, so that it can better support technology and innovation.</p>\n\n<p>I have a strong interest in software development process and evangelize that advantages of distributed version controls systems, particularly Mercurial, over traditional inflexible version control systems and the work-processes the create.</p>\n\n<p>In my spare time, I pursue interests in cosmology, quantum physics, and other fields of scientific learning and exploration.  My secret goal is to write software for quantum computers, ... mobile quantum computers (of course).</p>\n","Location":"Minneapolis, MN"}
