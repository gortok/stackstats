I enjoy coding web pages and writing short stories when I am not studying for an exam or reading a book.</p>\n\n<p>I am currently working on building a RPG using the DroidScript Javascript engine. I am also learning basic 2D and 3D art skills that I can apply in future projects. Also downloaded the jar for <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/candroidengine/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Candroidengine</a>, decompiled the jar and .class files and am working on editing the engine and fixing a few bugs for my use.</p>\n\n<p>I have limited experience with libGdx, however I hate Vector2's, which is kind of contradictory.</p>\n\n<p>After studying AI design over the summer, it turns out I like to make them. Yes, I am out to end the world!
