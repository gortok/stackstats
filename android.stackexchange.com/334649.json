Its the best user interface builder ever. I am thinking of building more than just games out of it. And the plugin architecture, while being a little difficult to start. Is still pretty amazing. It really lets me stretch my wings as far as development. One plugin for Windows, Another for Mac and a completely different one for android, iPhone etc.... Im like a kid in a candy store, only instead of candy its code.</p>\n\n<p>If you feel like contacting me, feel free to email me at thelazycoder@thelazycoder.com Networking with other coders is a good thing. (Please not about Stackoverflow questions. Programming Chat is good but Question Answer time is for the public)</p>\n","Location":"Las Vegas, NV"}
