I like to edit stuff and correct English, and I probably wash my hands too often but I don't have OCD (haha?). </p>\n\n<p>In the future, I would like to become a Linguist (also known as a translator or interpretor). I would like to be able to translate between Japanese&lt;->English, Korean&lt;->English and Korean&lt;->Japanese. However, I think I'll try to learn more languages :)</p>\n\n<p>Things I like doing are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Programming with Python</li>\n<li>Japanese stuff. Korean stuff. Speaking it, living it, smelling it. (?)</li>\n<li>Hacking when I can</li>\n<li>Modding the Sims 3 and other programs</li>\n<li>Messing with Ubuntu (and often for the worst)</li>\n<li>Play Skyrim, Tekkit, Minecraft, Sims 3, Final Fantasy and other games</li>\n<li>Geeking out</li>\n<li>Manga (Koizora = my favourite)</li>\n<li>Anime (Clannad, <strong><em>NANA</em></strong> and Reborn! being my absolute favourites) and</li>\n<li>K-Pop. Because it's awesome.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I work my way around, and am quite capable... but I still won't declare myself an expert yet :P</p>\n\n<p>I am one of the few females around here, though I am admittedly on the verge of being a boy. I am fairly feminine in real life, but I play Skyrim, Final Fantasy and hack and mod. What does that make me?!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, sorry for the long bio, thanks for visiting and bye!</p>\n","Location":"Somewhere over the rainbow"}
