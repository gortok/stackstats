Interested in using technology to make Social impact. \nI started writing programs in school days just for fun. I love coding. So, I have chosen Computer Science Engg and joined with lots of expectation. But, College didn't satisfied my coding thirst. My college provided only the outdated syllabus. So, I can't learn much through Engineering. But, Internet helped me a lot. I found out many online resources to learn new things. I was addicted to programming especially after learning PHP. Then, Got job and moved to Bangalore. Now, I'm with Witworks to do something awesome</p>\n","Location":"Chennai, India"}
