C/C++, Visual Basic and Java. So i know i can code. And there is a diploma hanging on my wall to prove it.\n.\nI am a professional, I am paid tons of cash to teach or do software development. I am roughly 30 years old .</p>\n\n<p>I hold lectures in programming. I have also coached students in C++, Java and Visual basic.</p>\n\n<p>In my spare time i do enjoy developing computer games, and i am developing a rather simple flight simulator game \nin the c++ programming language using the openGL graphics libray.</p>\n\n<p>I've written hundreds of thousands of code syntax lines for small simple applications and games.\nMember since Wednesday, December 20, 2006 (7 years, 8 months)</p>\n","Location":""}
