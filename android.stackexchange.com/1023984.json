My interests include programming, politics, economics &amp; global finance, biblical theology, formula one racing, cars, good beer or whiskey, and probably some other things I've neglected to mention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[GEEK]</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have been programming since I was 14, and have never looked back. As a professional developer I work for an airline as part of a scrum team, using the Microsoft technology stack. I am proficient in C#, ASP.NET, MVC, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript and jQuery. I am constantly working on personal development projects to sharpen my skills as a developer and keep my mind active and learning constantly. I also actively participate in the Typescript project on GitHub and have contributed to discussions surrounding the language and how it relates to ECMAScript.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[MONEY]</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am a great believer in digital currencies; BitCoin being the most popular of these right now. Anyone who understands fiat currency systems knows that they are not sustainable and inevitably lead to economic collapse. I genuinely believe that the future on global economic finance is in digital, cryptographically secure currency systems which do not follow the mechanics of fiat currency systems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[BEER]</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am by no means an aficionado when it comes to craft beer or whiskey. I’m relatively new to the scene and I know what I like; that being ultra-hoppy, small batch IPAs, and well-aged single malt whiskeys. My favourite brewery at the moment is Brewdog, but I have a few other favourites including The Kernel and Moor. My favourite beer at the moment is Brewdog IPA Is Dead - Citra. It’s a bit of a rarity as I believe it’s a seasonal beer, but boy-oh-boy…it’s good!</p>\n\n<p><strong>[GOD]</strong></p>\n\n<p>I was raised in a Christian family and at the age of 16, made the decision for myself to continue following in the faith. Since then there have been various aspects to my life where I have sought deep spiritual understanding from the faith and through biblical understanding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[FIN]</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well I guess that’s about enough background for now. Feel free to drop me a line with any questions or comments.</p>\n","Location":"United Kingdom"}
