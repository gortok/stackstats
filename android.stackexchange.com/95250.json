Engineer.  Professionally, I'm an experienced jack-of-all-trades in the Information Technology industry.  I work with everything from database administration, systems engineering, software engineering, and networking to project management and quality control.  While I am not a specialist in any particular area of the industry, my career has provided me with the experience to examine any professional problem from just about any viewpoint and thus determine the best solution and then implement it.  I have been building and programming on computers since the end of the 80â€™s (an 80386 DX2 25 MHz with 8 MB of RAM and a 90 MB hard drive with MS-DOS 5 and QBasic were my introduction to the world of computing).</p>\n","Location":"Houston, TX"}
