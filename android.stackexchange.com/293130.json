I've been running linux on just about all my systems for over 5 years, and at least partially using it since '95, mostly with Debian and now Ubuntu.  Lately I'm getting back into a project using C, maybe Lua, front end with php/ajax/js, and who knows what else.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of the techie stuff, I enjoy photography as a hobby and do a lot of home repair both on my own home and with the local Habitat chapter.  For fun, I strap the bare necessities onto my back and enjoy a weekend of backpacking.</p>\n","Location":"Virginia"}
