That's why I started my PhD in NLP, with my a master thesis in «<a href=\"http://xavi.ivars.me/bloc/2009/dea-superat/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Statistical models for vocabularies</a>».</p>\n\n<p>I speak Catalan, and Spanish as my second language. I also speak English, and I can have a simple conversation in French.</p>\n\n<p>Technology wise, I think languages, libraries and frameworks are here to help us, so I don't have strong opinions on \"X is much better than Y\", but instead I usually end up trying and using both X and Y for different purposes.</p>\n\n<p>I'm currently a Lead Software Engineer at Vistaprint, in Barcelona, working mainly in the Marketing Technology and Search (both paid and organic) areas.</p>\n","Location":"Benissa"}
