I started on an old PDP-8J with 3k of memory and 2 teletypes. I learned BASIC and Octal based assembly. I later moved into CPM, TR-DOS, Apple and finally into PC-DOS, Dr DOS and MS-DOS. I've been a beta tester for over a decade, got into web applications as a means to handle B2B requirements and have specialized in data movement between applications and businesses since. I have been a MVP, ASP Elite and was selected by Microsoft as one of the original 15 board members for ASPInsiders.","Location":"Colorado"}
