I work as a software engineer.</p>\n\n<p>I'm interested in Philosophy, Poetry, Theology and Art; and I'm not interested in Gaming, nor SF, nor computers or IT as a way of life.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also an occasionally practising artist &amp; poet; my art is probably better than my poetry - although thats getting better. Poets I admire are Yeats, Lorca and Walcott. </p>\n\n<p>Do you friend, know what it's all about?\nThe sun, a picture of health\nhangs still as a citrus fruit on a calm day.\nFlinty reflections in glass staring back at you,\nimitating each mellow or awkward move -\nNarcissus would not have known.</p>\n\n<p>Do you friend, know what its all about?\nConversation hiding open-eyed deceit.\nMustard oil for hasher-dim fried.\nLaughter with knives and smiles \nfor the coup-de-grace.\nPersophone in spring may know.</p>\n\n<p>And will we know what its all about? \nForever losing the living situation, \nOur inorganic sense drags us under,\nas our organic sense makes us hunger.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mozibur Ullah, Mar 2013</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\"Those who read me know my conviction that the world, the temporal world, rests on a few very simple ideas; so simple that they must be as old as the hills. It rests notably, among others, on the idea of Fidelity\".\n- Joseph Conrad</p>\n","Location":"London, United Kingdom"}
