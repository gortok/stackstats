Knowledgeable in C, UNIX and GNU/Linux operating systems, and (to a lesser extent) Java.</p>\n\n<p>My hobbies are mostly related to computer hardware. By hardware, I mean in the sense of microcontrollers, CPU's, and other computer components in the relatively discrete home computers of the 1980's. I have picked up some Z80 and 6502 assembly knowledge in the process, and written tiny programs for my VIC-20 and my NES/Famicom. I'm always eager to learn more about how they actually work at the lowest level, and I am proud to say I think I know enough to build a small, 1980's style one from the ground up now.</p>\n\n<p>I've got very little formal education beyond high school, but I've learned almost everything I know slowly on my own time. I find that easier than trying to deal with school's constant sense of urgency, though if I were paid to go to school I'd gladly deal with that.</p>\n","Location":"Fort Wayne, IN, United States"}
