Why\n\nDid you create us?! Time unfurls\nRelentlessly, and all it breeds\nIs pain, illusion, strife, foul deeds, \nIn a cruel and delirious whirl. . .\n\nWouldn’t it have been better for us\nTo remain in the peace of pre-matter,\nIn the eternal sleep of nothingness?\n\nWhy were we made, if pain is our greatest\nEnd?” But the gods, with a voice yet sadder,\nSay, “Why, O men, did you create us?”\n</code></pre>\n","Location":"Brazil"}
