I enjoy working across a large sweep of our application stack, including server-side Java, client-side Flex/HTML/JS, and our installed screen sharing client. Before moving to web conferencing, I designed and implemented process automation systems, including plant-wide electrical demand control and a variety of batch and continuous manufacturing processes.</p>\n","Location":"Pennsylvania"}
