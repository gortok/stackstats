In reality, it seems that I'll be pursuing a CE (hardware) degree, which I'm hoping will open the door to handheld gaming.</p>\n\n<p>I'm fluent in C, C++, PHP, and regular old SQL. I know HTML and CSS, and work my hardest to keep my code as close to the standards as possible, except where Internet Explorer doesn't support any standard way to do what I want.</p>\n\n<p>I play piano and tuba, and love to write my own music when I can find the time. My favorite video game is Final Fantasy IX.</p>\n","Location":"Corpus Christi, TX"}
