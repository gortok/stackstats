Online updates of MDB database content AND structure. In 1997.<br></li>\n<li>Access control system for an ISP. Kinda Rube Goldberg-ish. Lots of scripts that manipulate iptables to turn users to the login page, dhcpd to give thep IPs, cbq to assign them bandwidth etc.<br></li>\n<li>A security system for MS-DOS, implementing somewhat-Unix-style accounts and permissions.<br></li>\n<li>Clustering Asterisk PBXs for call centers.<br></li>\n<li>Autodialers with detection of human / answering machine / busy / bad number for (I'm going to Hell for this) active telemarketing. Please forgive me.<br></li>\n<li>A driver to integrate Skype into Asterisk. Even more Rube Goldberg-ish than the ISP login thing.<br></li>\n<li>Energy consumption billing through a proprietary board that \"ticked\" a bit in a parallel interface whenever X watts-hours had gone through path Y.<br></li>\n<li>Linux system-restore CDs.<br></li>\n<li>Satellite image acquiring through yet another proprietary expansion board, for Brazil's National Space Research Institute.<br></li>\n<li>REST services with Django.<br></li>\n<li>Remote system audits in C# using the OVAL language.<br></li>\n<li>For the retrocomputing fans out there: <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/cachars\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sourceforge.net/projects/cachars</a><br></li>\n<li>Lots more I sure forget about now.<br><br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Oh, and I just learned CUDA and Greenplum. They're neat. But I didn't get to use either in any project so far. :-/<br><br></p>\n\n<p>Things I like for fun:<br>\n- Formula One and Indy racing. (You get brownie points if you guess what race my avatar is from.)<br>\n- Reading in general, mostly nonfiction.<br>\n- Retrocomputing and retrogaming.<br>\n- Traveling, preferably overseas.<br>\n- Sci-fi in general, and Star Trek in particular.</p>\n","Location":"Rio De Janeiro, Brazil"}
