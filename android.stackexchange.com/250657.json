For example, I integrate Primavera with JD Edwards.  Or PeopleSoft, or Timberline, or, heck, even an Excel spreadsheet.</p>\n\n<p>I have a number of frameworks I've developed to help me do this.  Most of my work is done on C#, using Windows Forms, ASP.NET, and Silverlight.  I also play with developing WP7 apps for fun.</p>\n\n<p>Recently I've been playing with EC2, Sharepoint, and Powershell.  Learning a heck of alot and  having fun.</p>\n","Location":"Boulder, CO"}
