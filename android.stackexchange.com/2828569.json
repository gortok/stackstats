I spent 12 years operating Nuclear Power Plants for the US Navy, and I realized that was not where my passion was.  At the time I didn't know what area of IT I wanted to work in, but I knew I wanted to work with computers.  I took a pay cut as I left the Navy and started working as a Help Desk Technician for a local bank.  </p>\n\n<p>From there, I was torn.  Did I want to work in the realm of Network Infrastructure, or did I want to pursue a path of programming.  I decided I wanted to become a programmer, and the bank had an open position as an Information System Analyst.  That is what I do now while I am completing my Master's in Software Engineering.  I have a lot to learn about programming, and I am open to learn anything.</p>\n","Location":"Connecticut"}
