My core competence is as a technical specialist within development and system architecture. In my heart I am, and probably will remain, a programmer. I still think programming is tremendously fun, more than 20 years after I first tried it. That's why my blog is named <a href=\"http://coding.abel.nu\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Passion for Coding</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a consultant I take different roles in various projects. My favourite role is to combine system architecture with active development, but I am also doing some enterprise architecture and project management.</p>\n\n<p>Email: anders [at] abel [dot] nu.</p>\n","Location":"Stockholm, Sweden"}
