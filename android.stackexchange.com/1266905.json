Yes, back to those days it was the capital and was called this way. Now the city name is Almaty. I entered the 27 A-Level school and learnt there 11 years. I with my friend decided to enter Novosibirsk State University together. We went to the preparatory courses together. Then I have heard that there will be an enter exam to the Saint-Petersburg State University sooner then to Novosibirsk and I decided to try and passed... After graduation Saint-Petersburg University of Humanities I went back to Almaty where began my career.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My thoughts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wishes come true and it absolute. This is one interesting thing in wishes though: your fears is also a wish. So if you afraid that you fail being someone you wish to be then you risk to become the one you afraid to.</li>\n</ul>\n","Location":"Kazakhstan"}
