I'm bachelor grade computer systems analyst and working now as a web programmer, and when time allows, I'm developing some web stuff.</p>\n\n<p>As I have been playing PC games for about 15 years already, I'm interested in changing my main speciality and get into game development industry, maybe, as an QA tester. That would allow me to express my ideas and my point of view in this field.</p>\n","Location":"Riga, Latvia"}
