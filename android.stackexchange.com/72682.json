As a result you'll probably rarely see me contribute on the site anymore as I feel the moderators encourage abusive downvoting and penalise those of us who, frankly, have had enough.</p>\n\n<p>I was close to rage-quitting but:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It takes a long time to delete 136 quest.. oh I could just write a PhantomJS script to take care of that.., but more importantly\n<li>I've asked good questions, or given good answers in the past - and it would be a shame for such useful contributions to be lost from the Internet\n</ul>\n\n<p>So in spite of my distaste for some of the behaviours that take place on this site - I'll let things stay... for now. Having some moderator suspend you because he takes offence at a post <i>you</i> self-moderated (deleted) is, truthfully, abusive - and some of the moderators require suspensions.</p>\n","Location":"London, United Kingdom"}
