It impresses me, that some piece of text can make thinks happen and that you can create everything your mind can imagine.</p>\n\n<p>I'm interested in well structured and designed programs. I prefer the object-oriented paradigm, but I also know to write code in procedural languages like C.</p>\n\n<p>I try to write clean code, which is easy to test, maintainable, expandable and easy to change without great efforts. </p>\n\n<p>I'm also interested in testable code design (e.g by dependency injection) and software tests in general.</p>\n\n<p>I like code, which is easy to read and easy to understand, because programming is most of the time teamwork. I like re-factoring and design patterns as well.</p>\n","Location":"Bremen, Germany"}
