You might call me a bit of coding geek. I enjoy working on projects that involve a mix of Web and Graphic Design, Web Development, Mobile Application Development, Database Management and Programming.</p>\n\n<p>I have learned many technologies either independently or at college but it was always more rewarding when I learned things independently. The first program that I taught myself was Photoshop and After that I haven’t looked back.</p>\n\n<p>In the past 3 years I have worked on many projects that are linked on my website (baljeetsingh.in). I have worked on various technologies from front end to backend technologies including AngularJS, Ionic Framework, Wordpress, Laravel, ExpressJS, Bootstrap, Web Services, Woocommerce, Angular-Meteor, StrongLoop. But l love working on the projects where frontend and backend layers of project are sepearte like creating API with Laravel or Express for backend and consuming that API data with Angular or related frontend technologies.</p>\n\n<p>When I am not programming or designing with a computer, I like to practice vocal music and music production. I love playing computer games and my favorite game is FIFA. I also am a open source contributor.</p>\n\n<p>I have been a self-taught learner as long as I can remember and what I really love is sharing my findings and learnings with the world through through blogs, websites and in-person. I love the quote “Teaching someone else is the best way to learn”.</p>\n\n<p>My personal blog is: <a href=\"http://baljeetsingh.in/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://baljeetsingh.in/blog/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Handlers</strong> </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Facebook : mbaljeetsingh</li>\n<li>Twitter : mbaljeetsingh</li>\n<li>Linkedin : mbaljeetsingh</li>\n<li>Github : mbaljeetsingh</li>\n<li>Google Plus : +baljeetsingh</li>\n<li>Skype : sandhus8</li>\n</ol>\n","Location":"ludhiana"}
