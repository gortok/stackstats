My standing order is to make Ubuntu a wonderful place to participate, so if we're not making that happen for you let me know!  </p>\n\n<p>I try to focus on answering <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/tagged/community\">community</a> and <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/tagged/juju\">juju</a> tagged questions on Ask Ubuntu. Part of my job at Canonical is to help Ubuntu rock for you in the cloud, be it AWS, Azure, Google, Rackspace, Dreamhost, or your own OpenStack or bare metal. So if you're doing that and we're not being awesome for you then I'm your guy to help fix your problems. </p>\n\n<p>I tend to mingle on other tags and SE sites as well. I like dinosaurs, hockey, tacos, and heavy metal.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://jujucharms.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jujucharms.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Feel free to contact me via Launchpad: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://launchpad.net/~jorge\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://launchpad.net/~jorge</a> or on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/castrojo\" rel=\"nofollow\">@castrojo</a> or via mail, jorge at ubuntu dot com.</li>\n</ul>\n","Location":"Ann Arbor, MI"}
