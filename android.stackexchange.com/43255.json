Before I went over to the Dark Side, I worked as a software developer, mostly in C++ and SQL.  I still write code sometimes, but now only for prototypes and side projects.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I'm VP Product at <a href=\"http://cantaloupesys.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cantaloupe Systems</a>. We're the largest SaaS provider for the vending industry. </p>\n\n<p>At Cantaloupe Systems we put cellular modems inside vending machines, collect data about every sale as well as machine status and alerts, and then crunch the resulting data in our cloud services to help vending operators know which machines need to be refilled and when, what's selling and what's not, who's stealing, which machines are broken, and much more.  </p>\n\n<p>I lead a small team responsible for product roadmap, user experience, and agile project management while trying to keep customers happy and revenue growing.</p>\n\n<p>#SOreadytohelp</p>\n","Location":"Berkeley, CA"}
