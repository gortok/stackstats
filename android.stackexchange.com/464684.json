I am a general help-desk support technician, system administrator for small businesses, as well as a programmer. Most of the time I assist users with day-to-day troubleshooting issues as well as act as a IT consultant for small businesses (primarily medical offices). I began doing various IT-related work at the age  of 15 during the late 90's and still actively work in the field doing a plethora of different projects. I primarily work in the Central Florida area, but also provide remote assistance to clients across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Currently learning Python while working on some minor projects to help expand my programming portfolio. I'm hoping  to learn a lot from my fellow members here and welcome any critique or constructive criticism from my peers.</p>\n","Location":"Orlando, FL"}
