I started working with computers at age 11 and that's where my technical career started. I began to teach myself how to build websites and then program things from the well known \"Hello World\" programs, up to the great, big, and grand Android applications. I try to help with anything technical whenever and wherever it's needed. I enjoy working in the constant fast pace world that is technology and one day dream of working at Google. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for this amazing thing in our world.</p>\n\n<p>I am adept with several programming languages including Java, HTML, and XML. In my free time, I am an avid PC gamer. I like to play anything that gives me a challenge. I also hope to one day contribute to a famous game and/or make my own. The majority of my work consists of creating mobile apps for personal use on Android devices.</p>\n\n<p>Excited to hear that SO has reached 10,000,000+ questions! #SOreadytohelp</p>\n","Location":"United States"}
