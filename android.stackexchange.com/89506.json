Being a self-employed contractor, some of my non-technical tasks include QA, customer support, project management and scheduling.</p>\n\n<p>I have over 12 years commercial experience as a developer, plus another 10 before that as a hobbyist.  Working across numerous platforms and languages has given me the ability to pick up new projects rapidly, even in platforms new to me.  As a result, I feel that one of my great strengths is being able to tackle any IT problem with a great deal of success.</p>\n\n<p>Some of my non-IT experience involves office administration, inventory management and customer service.  Having 3 years customer service experience has given me a strong focus on customer support and QA in the IT field.</p>\n","Location":"Fremantle"}
