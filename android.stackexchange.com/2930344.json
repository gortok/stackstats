I started developing professionally Java and Android applications in the same year. I've worked remotely and collaborated in plenty of multi-discipline projects. Team work has been a must in most of all developed applications. I've led teams in development &amp; production stage with 100% success. From 2009 to 2015 I've actively participated in over 45 projects for third party enterprises and clients. Many of these apps are available for download on Google Play, some of them reaching over 1 million downloads.</p>\n\n<p>I love doing sports and dancing. I consider myself open-minded and I like to socialize all the time even though I take plenty of time to select my closest friends.</p>\n\n<p>My main goals in are simple: keep family and friends close, and to be able to work hard and with a lot of passion in software development to improve the user experience in and give the best of me to those IT geeks that I consider an extension of myself.</p>\n\n<p>Like in software, the most complex structures in life can be taken down to 1s and 0s. When it comes to people, what would you decide to be? Live, love, and be the 1 that makes a good change into the world.</p>\n","Location":"Boston, MA"}
