I've been their photographer and webmaster, having built their website as a class project and growing it to their current site. Additionally, I've been their roadie, studio technician, and helped upgrade their recording studio.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not as actively active on any Stack Exchange these days... too many irons in the fire.</p>\n\n<p>I can be found over at my sparsely populated <a href=\"http://blog.anonjr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">personal blog</a> from time to time and by my <a href=\"http://twitter.com/AnonJr\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter account</a>.
