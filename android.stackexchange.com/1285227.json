But I'm not completely blind fois scope too.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays I'm currently focused on web development with C#, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API and AngularJS. But I also have some considerable knowledge in XAML (WPF and UWP).</p>\n\n<p>I also have some interest in mobile development, specially for Window 10 Mobile, and in building games, but I still need some time to learn more on those two.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Zignd\" rel=\"nofollow\">I also have a GitHub account</a> that I like to use to show things that I'm working on and to use as a portfolio (and it's not dead like most peoples GitHub accounts xD).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg\" rel=\"nofollow\">I can draw 7 red lines</a></p>\n\n<p>And when I'm not coding I like to play video games (RPG &lt;3, FPS, etc.), to watch anime, TV shows and to read manga.</p>\n","Location":"SÃ£o Paulo - Brasil"}
