Currently my main clients are Financial Services behemoths, but I also dabble in the kool kid stuff for fun and profit, and I batter a guitar in the name of song and merriment in the bars of Switzerland from time to time, when I'm not skiing, cycling or working on code. Mail me at mel dot padden at gmail dot com. I try to update my blog but usually, I'm far too busy doing real work.</p>\n","Location":"Zurich, Switzerland"}
