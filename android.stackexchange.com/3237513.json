I am currently 15 years old (born in 1999). I develop software, build robots, make music, and play in a band. I am currently developing utility software and simple games using Java. I am working primarily in cryptography software. I build walking robots and robotic arms using the Arduino microcontroller. I play in my band as the lead guitarist and singer, with my buddies Paul Schnadig (rhythm guitar), Jivan Galper (bass), Nick Owen (drums) and Jack Zuffante (saxophone and keyboard). I also create music on my own (mostly rock and electronic). I spend my free time programming, gaming, building, playing and creating music, and thinking.</p>\n","Location":"Concord, MA"}
