It feels quite the same to me. I do data analysis during my day job as a PhD student, but I also write web applications and have started digging into Android. </p>\n\n<p>I am always excited to learn about the new and shiny. In the years since I started programming, a lot of progress has been made in software development and operations. It is an exciting time to be alive.</p>\n","Location":"Germany"}
