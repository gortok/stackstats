I worked for a company called Roundarch Isobar where I work primarily on web-applications built in Flex and service layer code using Java (Spring, iBatis, BlazeDS) and Teradata from 2009-2012.  Since then I've been learning the ropes in AngularJS, porting some knowledge and building web-apps.  Mid 2013 I'm starting my own consulting business and am currently working on an urban agriculture project for mapping sites in Chicago and tracking crop growth information.</p>\n\n<p>I love programming (or rather problem solving) and helping people out is okay too.  I ultimately went to DePaul University and received a BS in Computer Science.</p>\n","Location":"Chicago, IL"}
