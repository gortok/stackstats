This format of TeX.SX suits me well, I wish I found it earlier, I was wondering where TeXists share their experiments and unfinished work next to CTAN, TUGboat, CSTUG Zpravodaj etc. where rather finished work is presented.</p>\n\n<p>My contributions in the TeX world: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I helped Michal Mádr with translation and polishing of the <a href=\"http://ctan.org/pkg/lshort-czech\" rel=\"nofollow\">lshort-czech</a> manual.</li>\n<li>My family and I helped Jano Kula &amp; comp. with organizing the <a href=\"http://meeting.contextgarden.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ConTeXt meetings</a> in 2010 and 2013 hold in Brejlov near Prague.</li>\n<li>My colleagues (Zdeněk Wagner, Miloš Brejcha, Jan Šustek and many more), my family and I with support of <a href=\"http://www.cstug.cz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CSTUG</a> have organized the <a href=\"http://www.cstug.cz/konference/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TeXperience</a> conferences since 2008 (it has been rather local gathering of Czech and Slovak TeXists). I have no plans organizing it again (2014+). I used all my ideas and I think TeXists could go to a pub without my intervention.</li>\n<li>I helped with <a href=\"http://bulletin.cstug.cz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zpravodaj</a> of the CSTUG.</li>\n<li>These days I am responsible for the TeX section of the <a href=\"http://ossconf.soit.sk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OSSConf conference</a> which will take place in Žilina, Slovakia, July, 1-3, 2015. I am doing so since 2010 with Aleš Kozubík, present chief organizer of the conference.</li>\n<li>I was teaching TeX and friends at university in Zlín since around 2004. The faculty management cancelled my course in 2012 without noticing me in advance, so I left university after I had finished what needed to be accomplished.</li>\n<li>I published some <a href=\"http://striz7.fame.utb.cz/courses/dep/soubory/tex-and-friends.rar\" rel=\"nofollow\">books</a> and articles about TeX, but the topics are not important.</li>\n<li>I was working on a book on TikZ+pgfplots, a small collection of older snippets is available at <a href=\"http://striz7.fame.utb.cz/courses/dep/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://striz7.fame.utb.cz/courses/dep/</a>, but I wasn't sure if it is a good idea to work on it anymore after discovering <a href=\"http://texample.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TeXample</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In my work, I am mixing the LaTeX format with the TeX primitives frequently. I keen to LuaLaTeX. I like that idea of learning modern programming language and doing some TeXing at the same time. My first testing project of computing something like 1200! used <a href=\"http://oss.digirati.com.br/luabignum/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BigNum and BigRat</a> libraries.</p>\n\n<p>I am using all major graphics engines at a certain level: Metapost, PSTricks, Asymptote and TikZ+pgfplots. I welcomed tikzDevice library in R, TikZ3, I like export options in GeoGebra. I like many packages and dirty tricks.</p>\n\n<p>The Python world: I like Sage, Sage notebook and an idea of the SageTeX created by Robert Mařík from Brno, the Czech Republic.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's get back to the (Lua)TeX world...</p>\n\n<p>P.S.
