(A job I found on Stack Overflow Careers, thank you very much.)  I'm interested in lots of extra-curricular software development activity (user groups, conventions, panels, etc.) as well as general local geekery (gaming, geocaching, anything fun).</p>\n\n<p>Career aspirations involve becoming a better developer, a better architect, and maybe even getting published once I find something about which to write.</p>\n","Location":"Boston, MA"}
