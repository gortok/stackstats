Have been enthusiastically studying AI until discovered that Machine Learning is a codename for Applied Statistics. I hold BSc with Hons in AI and CS from University of Edinburgh. Now, working on down-to-earth practical things, mostly in .NET and Python.<br>\nBelieve that forcing users to upgrade to a newer version is perfectly acceptable.\nKeep shuffling tons of books on my shelves that I have never read. Maybe one day, who knows? Though if I donâ€™t click after first few pages I rarely ever come back.</p>\n\n<p>Strongly support free, civic society in any conceivable aspect of it, especially speech, civil liberties and most importantly adaptation of debt-free money by governments. </p>\n\n<p>In my daily choices I tend to put the ugliest practice above the most beautiful theory; doing over talking, impact and change over expectations and hope.</p>\n\n<p>In my free time I enjoy dabbling with Haskell and AppEngine also help my wife a bit making craft for toddlers.</p>\n\n<p>Love badminton and rollerblading despite all the injuries.</p>\n","Location":""}
