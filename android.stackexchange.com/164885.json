A background in electronics,repair and nuclear engineering. (Honest!)</p>\n\n<p>I enjoy reading, discovering new things, music and my computers.<br>\n<strike>(and long walks on the beach, large dogs and chocolate... yeah yeah)</strike></p>\n\n<p>Warped, offbeat sense of humor, been told I have \"<strong>The Knack</strong>\", learned it's not fatal though, whew!</p>\n\n<p>For the most part... \"I make things work.â„¢\"</p>\n\n<p>I really hate telling someone \"NO, you can't do that\", so I often find some offbeat method to accomplish things.  Nothing is really impossible, just some things are more difficult to do than others.  It's those 'difficult' things I enjoy.  The Challenge!</p>\n\n<p>{Chuckle} Ok, so I'm easily amused, but I do find it interesting with the 'badges'.  Well done, it's like those nasty farm games on those toy sites, but more entertaining because I learn while earning them.  Yaay!</p>\n","Location":"Livermore, CA"}
