I believe teaching and giving is the best way to learn and receive.</p>\n\n<p>I develop web applications with PHP, Mysql, javascript\nHowever i know C, C++, Java, Ruby and Shell script.</p>\n\n<p>My main interest now is to learn to model situations. Convert real life and ambiguous situations into deterministic (the most possible xD) comprehensive models. I believe this is the most important part for us (programmers). After a model is given, anyone can translate it to machine language.</p>\n","Location":"Caracas, Venezuela"}
