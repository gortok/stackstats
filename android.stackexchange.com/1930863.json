I’m passionate about MongoDB and am a teaching assistant for two of their online courses:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101P/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">M101P: MongoDB for Python Developers</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M102/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">M102: MongoDB for DBAs</a></p>\n\n<p>I received my AB from Harvard University and completed intensive studies in Computer Science and Statistics at Stanford. While in college I was one of the co-founders of Vostu, back when it was a social network for Latin America. I started my professional career at Sotheby’s and then founded Newertown, a creative arts consultancy firm that helped emerging artists and arts startups engage audiences through digital media. We were involved in the production of the first major Pan-Arab arts exhibition at the Venice Biennale and the first large-scale contemporary art exhibition in Jeddah. At present I’m director of <a href=\"http://mimanzana.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mimanzana</a>, a digital marketing firm based in Lima, Peru.</p>\n","Location":"London, United Kingdom"}
