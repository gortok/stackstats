Historically I've worked implementing various CMS solutions for various different industries.</p>\n\n<p>After a few years of doing this I'm tired of C# because everyone abuses the fact that (almost) everything is nullable; tired of html (seriously why don't we use xhtml) because I haven't worked with a single developer who would validate his code; and tired of building things inside other peoples frameworks because I haven't ever seen a framework that was good for what it was being used for.</p>\n\n<p>I'm that guy who writes hobby projects in C because object orientation is so abused, thinks that a .Net class library should have exactly one class exposed (hence the name), and gets annoyed whenever anyone eats exceptions. In summary I'm a boring programmer that hates everyone.</p>\n","Location":"Australia"}
