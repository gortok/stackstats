I came to the Bay area as a researcher in the theory of intelligence. I apply that previous work to my code, whether it's design, architecture, logic, or style.</p>\n\n<p>I'm looking to gain experience in distributed computing and how machine inference is applied in practice. I want to understand what learning algorithms can do, push their boundaries, and then extend them.</p>\n","Location":"Berkeley, CA"}
