I dabble a lot and have built websites and Windows apps, but I don't consider myself a programmer, as I don't really know whether I am doing it right. (but my applications and websites work, just don't know if I am using the best methods and techniques etc... example I once used a DataTable rather than a Generic.Dictionary - Newbie!!! - But don't worry I have fixed that now. ;))\n<br/><br/>\nCurrently a Support Manager/IT Manager for an MIS software company.</p>\n\n<p>Thoroughly enjoying MongoDB, Node.JS and Express at the moment.</p>\n","Location":"London, United Kingdom"}
