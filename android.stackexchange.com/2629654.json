Furthermore the <strong>efficiency</strong> matters much more than that my code simply works.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I can answer the questions during <strong>weekends only</strong>, because I have already <strong>dedicated</strong> my working hours <strong>only</strong> to my <strong>employer</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Mostly I am trying to give the <strong>solution + explanation</strong> which helps the readers to understand the problem and the solution <strong>clearly</strong> and much more <strong>important</strong> that they should not make the <strong>same mistake again</strong>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>\"My answers should be the full stop for them rather a comma.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Would you like to get to know me more...? just visit my home page <a href=\"http://goppinath.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>goppinath.com</strong></a></p>\n","Location":"NRW, Germany"}
