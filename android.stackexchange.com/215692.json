I work with PHP, MySQL and jQuery. I prefer to build websites with WordPress. My work environment is Window 10 with Photoshop and PHPStorm. My preferred server environment is a typical LAMP stack. I've got gripes with Plesk and cPanel but deal with them anyways. I'm a huge fan of Digital Ocean, Server Pilot and Advanced Custom Fields.</p>\n","Location":"Eugene, OR"}
