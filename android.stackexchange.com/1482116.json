My family was hunted leaving me all alone when my house targeted and deliberately set on a fire by a mob during a nonsense communal riot but I was survived by a rescue team with the help of firemen. As a survival, I didn't know whether it was my fortune or misfortune but when I recovered, the rescue team came to my home, one day. One of the members gave me a piece of paper in my hand in which the following text was written.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>lifeisnowhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He asked me to read it carefully and I could hardly interpret the text as </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Life is now here,</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>instead of</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Life is nowhere.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All of them gave me a cute smile and went away and I decided to live peacefully and hopefully on their saying from then onwards and very soon.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Because of this tragedy, I'm alone couldn't join a school but a curiosity to learn something made me a self-learner.
