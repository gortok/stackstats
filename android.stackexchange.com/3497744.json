It will be free from policies and strict rules. It will not be a Q2A library. It will be a community. <a href=\"http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/101500/horizontal-projectile-motion-finding-the-height-of-the-object-at-a-given-time\">Genuine questions</a> will not be closed as homework. Those <a href=\"http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/110298/can-someone-recommend-good-resources-to-self-study-physics-please\">who need help for resource recommendation</a> will be helped. It will be a <a href=\"http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/a/12743/103816\">community like Math.SE</a>.  There will be fun, not humiliation. A community website free from some old cranky farts.  </p>\n\n<p>Now a days Phys.SE doesn't welcome beginners and they are outnumbered on <a href=\"http://meta.physics.stackexchange.com/q/5781/31782\">meta too</a> with the downvotes.   </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I've proposed a new website for Physics problems on Area51. Intereseted users can follow it.<br>\n<a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/69198/physics-problems?referrer=jpFTJqd3z6Dqi4sXlAyGiw2\"><img src=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/ads/proposal/69198.png\" width=\"220\" height=\"250\" alt=\"Stack Exchange Q&amp;A site proposal: Physics problems\" /></a></p>\n","Location":"India"}
