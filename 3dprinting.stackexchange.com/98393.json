Most are in Perl or Python, and many have to do with XML and many other data formats; text and natural language processing, and corpus linguistics. Several are clones of standard *nix filters, but with fixes such as being able to handle Unicode, a much wider variety of CSV-ish formats, etc.</p>\n\n<p>No guarantees, but I use most of them heavily myself, and I wrote them because I thought the functionality proved useful.</p>\n","Location":"East Coast"}
