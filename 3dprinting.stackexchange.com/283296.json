I was hired shortly before I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona, where I earned my B.S. in Computer Science.  I became interested in computers when I was a kid, and took my first programming course in 7th grade. One of the rewarding, and fun experiences I have had over the years has been teaching, which I am hope to do again some day. In 2009, I earned an MBA with an emphasis on Information Systems from the University of Redlands.</p>\n\n<p>As far as my personal life goes, I have many hobbies like Photography, Motorcycling, Cars, Tech Toys, collecting and building LEGO, and collecting Transformers (new and old).</p>\n","Location":"Fontana, CA"}
