For me the Internet is a wealth of information that speaks to me saying, \"you can do whatever is possible\". I love Physics and the laws that govern our universe, because the better I understand them the more I can do. Computer and processor programming is my hobby and a good tool for demonstrating and executing my physical ideas.</p>\n","Location":"Huntsville, AL"}
