I was very involved at different levels in Wikipedia and sister projects for 5 years, until 2008. Consumed most of my spare time, then. But it was worth it.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2008, I have some fun with <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenStreeMap</a>. Great project!</p>\n\n<p>I also wrote a XML generation library in Java, based on a stack used for depth-priority tree processing. I stopped the development when it became obvious I was actually remaking the generation part of StAX... Currently, I'm working on a multithreading library in Java, based on a graph model, each node being a thread. It's called <a href=\"https://github.com/Traroth/Archipel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Archipel</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I hope to get some time (if my current move from one corner of Paris to another finally takes an end...) to write an image manipulation library in Java.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also a real free software maniac. Free as in free speech...</p>\n\n<p>My other center of interest are photography (I got a Canon 7D I'm having real fun with. I took the picture of a polar fox I'm using as an avatar with my older 350D), cooking (I'm french, after all :-) and seeing museums, especially art (I can't grow tired of the Marmottan Museum and its unique Monet paintings collection).</p>\n\n<p>My 2 mother tongues are french and german, and apparently I'm not all so bad in english... :-). Beside France, I worked in Germany and Switzerland (where I also lived).</p>\n","Location":"Paris, France"}
